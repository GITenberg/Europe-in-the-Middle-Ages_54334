<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>The history of Mediaeval Europe is so vast a subject
that the attempt to deal with it in a small compass must
entail either severe compression or what may appear at
first sight reckless omission.</p>

<p>The path of compression has been trodden many times,
as in J.&nbsp;H. Robinson’s <cite>Introduction to the History of
Western Europe</cite>, or in such series as the ‘Periods of
European History’ published by Messrs. Rivingtons for
students, or text-books of European History published
by the Clarendon Press and Messrs. Methuen.</p>

<p>To the authors of all these I should like to express my
indebtedness both for facts and perspective, as to Mr. H.&nbsp;W.
Davis for his admirable summary of the mediaeval outlook
in the Home University Library series; but in spite
of so many authorities covering the same ground, I
venture to claim for the present book a pioneer path of
‘omission’; it may be reckless but yet, I believe, justifiable.</p>

<p>It has been my object not so much to supply students
with facts as to make Mediaeval Europe live, for the many
who, knowing nothing of her history, would like to know
a little, in the lives of her principal heroes and villains, as
well as in the tendencies of her classes, and in the beliefs
and prejudices of her thinkers. This task I have found
even more difficult than I had expected, for limits of space
have insisted on the omission of many events and names
I would have wished to include. These I have sacrificed
to the hope of creating reality and arousing interest, and
if I have in any way succeeded I should like to pay my
thanks first of all to Mr. Henry Osborn Taylor for his two
volumes of <cite>The Mediaeval Mind</cite> that have been my chief
inspiration, and then to the many authors whose names
and books I give elsewhere, and whose researches have
enabled me to tell my tale.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE GREATNESS OF ROME</span></h2>
</div>

<p>‘<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ave, Roma Immortalis!</i>’, ‘<em>Hail, Immortal Rome!</em>’ This
cry, breaking from the lips of a race that had carried the
imperial eagles from the northern shores of Europe to Asia and
Africa, was no mere patriotic catchword. It was the expression
of a belief that, though humanity must die and personal ambitions
fade away, yet Rome herself was eternal and unconquerable,
and what was wrought in her name would outlast the ages.</p>

<p>In the modern world it is sometimes necessary to remind
people of their citizenship, but the Roman never forgot the
greatness of his inheritance. When St. Paul, bound with
thongs and condemned to be scourged, declared, ‘I am Roman
born,’ the Captain of the Guard, who had only gained his
citizenship by paying a large sum of money, was afraid of the
prisoner on whom he had laid hands without a trial.</p>

<p>To be a Roman, however apparently poor and defenceless,
was to walk the earth protected by a shield that none might set
aside save at great peril. Not to be a Roman, however rich
and of high standing, was to pass in Roman eyes as a ‘barbarian’,
a creature of altogether inferior quality and repute.</p>

<p>‘Be it thine, O Roman,’ says Virgil, the greatest of Latin
poets, ‘to govern the nations with thy imperial rule’: and such
indeed was felt by Romans to be the destiny of their race.</p>

<p>Stretching on the west through Spain and Gaul to the
Atlantic, that vast ‘Sea of Darkness’ beyond which according
to popular belief the earth dropped suddenly into nothingness,
the outposts of the Empire in the east looked across the plains
of Mesopotamia towards Persia and the kingdoms of central
Asia. Babylon ‘the Wondrous’, Syria, and Palestine with its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
turbulent Jewish population, Egypt, the Kingdom of the Pharaohs
long ere Romulus the City-builder slew his brother, Carthage,
the Queen of Mediterranean commerce, all were now Roman
provinces, their lustre dimmed by a glory greater than they
had ever known.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roman Trade Routes</div>

<p>The Mediterranean, once the battle-ground of rival Powers,
had become an imperial lake, the high road of the grain ships
that sailed perpetually from Spain and Egypt to feed the central
market of the world; for Rome, like England to-day, was quite
unable to satisfy her population from home cornfields. The
fleets that brought the necessaries of life convoyed also shiploads
of oriental luxuries, silks, jewels, and perfumes, transported
from Ceylon and India in trading-sloops to the shores of the Red
Sea, and thence by caravans of camels to the port of Alexandria.</p>

<p>Other trade routes than the Mediterranean were the vast
network of roads that, like the threads of a spider’s web, kept
every part of the Empire, however remote, in touch with the
centre from which their common fate was spun. At intervals of
six miles were ‘post-houses’, provided each with forty or more
horses, that imperial messengers, speeding to or from the
capital with important news, might dismount and mount again at
the different stages, hastening on their way with undiminished
speed.</p>

<p>How firm and well made were their roads we know to-day,
when, after the lapse of nearly nineteen centuries of traffic, we
use and praise them still. They hold in their strong foundations
one secret of their maker’s greatness, that the Roman brought
to his handiwork the thoroughness inspired by a vision not
merely of something that should last a few years or even his
lifetime, but that should endure like the city he believed eternal.</p>

<p>It was the boast of Augustus, 27 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>–<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 14, the first of the
Roman Emperors, that he had found his capital built of brick and
had left it marble; and his tradition as an architect passed to his
successors. There are few parts of what was once the Roman
Empire that possess no trace to-day of massive aqueduct or
Forum, of public baths or stately colonnades. In Rome itself,
the Colosseum, the scene of many a martyr’s death and gladiator’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
struggle; elsewhere, as at Nîmes in southern France, a provincial
amphitheatre; the aqueduct of Segovia in Spain, the baths in
England that have made and named a town; the walls that mark
the outposts of empire&mdash;all are the witnesses of a genius that
dared to plan greatly, nor spared expense or labour in carrying
out its designs.</p>

<p>Those who have visited the Border Country between England
and Scotland know the Emperor Hadrian’s wall, twenty feet
high by seven feet broad, constructed to keep out the fierce Picts
and Scots from this the most northern of his possessions. Those
of the enemy that scaled the top would find themselves faced by
a ditch and further wall, bristling with spears; while the legions
flashed their summons for reinforcements from guardhouse to
guardhouse along the seventy miles of massive barrier. All that
human labour could do had made the position impregnable.</p>

<p>A scheme of fortifications was also attempted in central
Europe along the lines of the Rhine and Danube. These rivers
provided the third of the imperial trade routes, and it is well to
remember them in this connexion, for their importance as highways
lasted right through Roman and mediaeval into modern
times. Railways have altered the face of Europe: they have
cut through her waste places and turned them into thriving
centres of industry: they have looped up her mines and ports
and tunnelled her mountains: there is hardly a corner of any
land where they have not penetrated; and the change they have
made is so vast that it is often difficult to imagine the world before
their invention. In Roman times, in neighbourhoods where the
sea was remote and road traffic slow and inconvenient, there only
remained the earliest of all means of transport, the rivers. The
Rhine and Danube, one flowing north-west, the other south-east,
both neither too swift nor too sluggish for navigation, were the
natural main high roads of central Europe: they were also an
obvious barrier between the Empire and barbarian tribes.</p>

<p>To connect the Rhine and Danube at their sources by
a massive wall, to establish forts with strong garrisons at every
point where these rivers could be easily forded, such were the
precautions by which wise Emperors planned to shut in Rome’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
civilization, and to keep out all who would lay violent hands
upon it.</p>

<p>The Emperor Augustus left a warning to his successors that
they should be content with these natural boundaries, lest in
pushing forward to increase their territory they should in reality
weaken their position. It is easy to agree with his views centuries
afterwards, when we know that the defences of the Empire,
pushed ever forward, snapped at the finish like an elastic band;
but the average Roman of imperial days believed his nation
equal to any strain.</p>

<p>It was a boast of the army that ‘Roman banners never retreat’.
If then a tribe of barbarians were to succeed in fording the Danube
and in surprising some outpost fort, the legions sent to punish
them would clamour not merely to exact vengeance and return
home, but to conquer and add the territory to the Empire. In
the case of swamps or forest land the clamour might be checked;
but where there was pasturage or good agricultural soil, it would
be almost irresistible. Emigrants from crowded Italy would
demand leave to form a colony, traders would hasten in their
footsteps, and soon another responsibility of land and lives,
perhaps with no natural protection of river, sea, or mountains,
would be added to Rome’s burden of government. Such was
the fertile province of Dacia, north of the Danube, a notable
gain in territory, but yet a future source of weakness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Government of the Roman Empire</div>

<p>At the head of the Empire stood the Emperor, ‘Caesar
Augustus’, the commander-in-chief of the army, the supreme
authority in the state, the fountain of justice, a god before whose
altar every loyal Roman must burn incense and bow the knee in
reverence.</p>

<p>It was a great change from the old days, when Rome was
a republic, and her Senate, or council of leading citizens, had
been responsible to the rest of the people for their good or bad
government. The historian Tacitus, looking back from imperial
days with a sigh of regret, says that in that happy age man
could speak what was in his mind without fear of his neighbours,
and draws the contrast with his own time when the Emperor’s
spies wormed their way into house and tavern, paid to betray<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
those about them to prison or death for some chance word or
incautious action. Yet Rome by her conquests had brought on
herself the tyranny of the Empire.</p>

<p>It is comparatively easy to rule a small city well, where fraud
and self-seeking can be quickly detected; but when Rome
began to extend her boundaries and to employ more people in
the work of government, unscrupulous politicians appeared.
These built up private fortunes during their term of office: they
became senators, and the Senate ceased to represent the will of
the people and began to govern in the interests of a small
group of wealthy men. Members of their families became
governors of provinces, first in Italy, and then as conquests
continued, across the mountains in Gaul and Spain, and beyond
the seas in Egypt and Asia Minor. Except in name, senators
and governors ceased to be simple citizens and lived as princes,
with officials and servants ready to carry out their slightest
wish.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may seem odd that the Roman people, once so fond
of liberty that they had driven into exile the kings who oppressed
them, should afterwards let themselves be bullied or neglected
by a hundred petty tyrants; but in truth the people had
changed even more than the class of ‘patricians’ to whom they
found themselves in bondage.</p>

<p>No longer pure Roman or Latin, but through conquest and
intermarriage of every race from the stalwart Teuton to the
supple Oriental or swarthy Egyptian, few amongst the men and
women crowding the streets of Rome remembered or reverenced
the traditions of her early days. Rome stood for military glory,
luxury, culture, at her best for even-handed justice, but no longer
for an ideal of liberty. If national pride was satisfied, and
adequate food and amusement provided, the Roman populace
was content to be ruled from above and to hail rival senators as
masters, according to the extent of their promises and success.
A failure to fulfil such promises, resulting in a lost campaign or
a dearth of corn, would throw the military tyrant of the moment
from his pedestal, but only to set up another in his place.</p>

<p>It was an easy transition from the rule of a corrupt Senate to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
that of an autocrat. ‘Better one tyrant than many’ was the
attitude of mind of the average citizen towards Octavius Caesar,
when under the title of Augustus he gathered to himself the
supreme command over army and state and so became the
first of the Emperors. Had he been a tactless man and shouted
his triumph to the Seven Hills he would probably have fallen a
victim to an assassin’s knife; but he skilfully disguised his
authority and posed as being only the first magistrate of the
state.</p>

<p>Under his guiding hand the Senate was reformed, and
its outward dignity rather increased than shorn. Augustus
could issue his own ‘edicts’ or commands independently of the
Senate’s consent; but he more frequently preferred to lay his
measures before it, and to let them reach the public as a
senatorial decree. In this he ran no risk, for the senators,
impressive figures in the eyes of the ordinary citizen, were
really puppets of his creation. At any minute he could cast
them away.</p>

<p>His fellow magistrates were equally at his mercy, for in his hands
alone rested the supreme military command, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">imperium</i>,
from which the title of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">imperator</i>, or ‘emperor’, was derived.
At first he accepted the office only for ten years, but at the end
of that time, resigning it to a submissive Senate, he received it
again amid shouts of popular joy. The tyranny of Augustus
had proved a blessing.</p>

<p>Instead of corps of troops raised here and there in different
provinces by governors at war with one another, and thus
divided in their allegiance, there had begun to develop a disciplined
army, whose ‘legions’ were enrolled, paid, and dismissed
in the name of the all-powerful Caesar, and who therefore
obeyed his commands rather than those of their immediate
captains.</p>

<p>The same system of centring all authority in one absolute
ruler was followed in the civil government. Governors of
provinces, once petty rulers, became merely servants of the state.
Caesar sent them from Rome: he appointed the officials under
them: he paid them their salaries: and to him they must give an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
account of their stewardship. ‘If thou let this man go thou art
not Caesar’s friend.’ Such was the threat that induced Pontius
Pilate, Governor of Judea in the reign of Tiberius, to condemn
to death a man he knew to be innocent of crime.</p>

<p>This is but one of many stories that show the dread of the
Emperor’s name in Rome’s far-distant provinces. Governors,
military commanders, judges, tax-collectors, all the vast army of
officials who bore the responsibility of government on their
shoulders, had an ultimate appeal from their decisions to
Caesar, and were exalted by his smile or trembled at his frown.</p>

<p>It is not a modern notion of good government, this complete
power vested in one man, but Rome nearly two thousand years
ago was content that a master should rule her, so long as
he would guarantee prosperity and peace at home. This under
the early Caesars was at least secured.</p>

<p>Two fleets patrolled the Mediterranean, but their vigilance was
not needed, save for an occasional brush with pirates. Naught
but storms disturbed her waters. The legions on the frontiers,
whether in Syria or Egypt, or along the Rhine and Danube, kept
the barbarians at bay until Romans ceased to think of war as a
trade to which every man might one day be called. It was
a profession left to the few, the ‘many’ content to pay the taxes
required by the state and to devote themselves to a civilian’s life.</p>

<p>To one would fall the management of a large estate, another
would stand for election to a government office, a third would
become a lawyer or a judge. Others would keep shops or
taverns or work as hired labourers, while below these again
would be the class of slaves, whether prisoners of war sold in the
market-place or citizens deprived of their freedom for crime
or debt.</p>

<p>In Rome itself was a large population, living in uncomfortable
lodging-houses very like the slum tenements of a modern city.
Some of the inhabitants would be engaged in casual labour, some
idle; but when the Empire was at its zenith lavish gifts of corn
from the government stood between this otherwise destitute
population and starvation. It crowded the streets to see
Caesar pass, threw flowers on his chariot, and hailed him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
as Emperor and God, and in return he bestowed on it food and
amusements.</p>

<p>The huge amphitheatres of Rome and her provinces were
built to satisfy the public desire for pageantry and sport; and,
because life was held cheap, and for all his boasted civilization
the Roman was often a savage at heart, he would spend his
holidays watching the despised sect of Christians thrown to the
lions, or hired gladiators fall in mortal struggle. ‘We, about to
die, salute thee.’ With these words the victims of an emperor’s
lust of bloodshed bent the knee before the imperial throne, and
at Caesar’s nod passed to slay or be slain. The emperor’s
sceptre did not bring mercy, but order, justice, and prosperity
above the ordinary standard of the age.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DECLINE OF ROME</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The years of Rome’s greatness seemed to her sons an age of
gold, but even at the height of her prosperity there were traces
of the evils that brought about her downfall. An autocracy, that
is, the rule of one man, might be a perfect form of government
were the autocrat not a man but a god, thus combining superhuman
goodness and understanding with absolute power.
Unfortunately, Roman emperors were representatives of human
nature in all its phases. Some, like Augustus, were great rulers;
others, though good men, incompetent in the management of
public affairs; whilst not a few led evil lives and regarded their
office as a means of gratifying their own desires.</p>

<p>The Emperor Nero (54–68), for instance, was cruel and profligate,
guilty of the murder of his half-brother, mother, and wife,
and also of the deaths of numberless senators and citizens whose
wealth he coveted. Because he was an absolute ruler his corrupt
officials were able to bribe and oppress his subjects as they
wished until he was fortunately assassinated. He was the last of
his line, the famous House of Julius to which Augustus had
belonged, and the period that followed his death was known as
‘the year of the four Emperors’, because during that time no
less than four rivals claimed and struggled for the coveted
honour.</p>

<p>Nominally, the right of election lay with the Senate, but the
final champion, Vespasian (69–79), was not even a Roman nor an
aristocrat, but a soldier from the provinces. He had climbed the
ladder of fame by sheer endurance and his power of managing
others, and his accession was a triumph not for the Senate but
the legions who had supported him and who now learned their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
power. Henceforward it would be the soldier with his naked
sword who could make and unmake emperors, and especially the
Praetorian Guard whose right it was to maintain order in Rome.</p>

<p>The gradual recognition of this idea had a disastrous effect on
the government of the Empire. Too often the successful general
of a campaign on the frontier would remember Vespasian and
become obsessed with the thought that he also might be a
Caesar. Led by ambition he would hold out to his legions hopes
of the rewards they would receive were he crowned in Rome,
and some sort of bargain would be struck, lowering the tone of
the army by corrupting its loyalty and making its soldiers
insolent and grasping.</p>

<p>The Senate attempted to deal with this difficulty of the
succession by passing a law that every Emperor should, during
his lifetime, name his successor, and that the latter should at once
be hailed as Caesar, take a secondary share in the government,
and have his effigy printed on coins. In this way he would
become known to the whole Roman world, and when the
Emperor died would at once be acknowledged in his place.
Thus the Romans hoped to establish the theory that England
expresses to-day in the phrase ‘The King never dies’.</p>

<p>Though to a certain extent successful in their efforts to avoid
civil war, they failed to arrest other evils that were undermining
the prosperity of the government. One of these was the
imperial expenditure. It was only natural that the Emperor
should assume a magnificence and liberality in excess of his
wealthiest subjects, but in addition he found it necessary to buy
the allegiance of the Praetorian Guard and to keep the Roman
populace satisfied in its demands for free corn and expensive
amusements.</p>

<p>The standard of luxury had grown, and Romans no longer
admired, except in books, the simple life of their forefathers.
Instead the fashionable ideal was that of the East they had
enslaved, and the Emperor was gradually shut off from the mass
of his subjects by a host of court officials who thronged his antechambers
and exacted heavy bribes for admission. In this
unhealthy atmosphere suspicion and plots grew apace like weeds,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
and money dripped through the imperial fingers as through a
sieve, now into the pockets of one favourite, now of another.</p>

<p>‘I have lost a day,’ was said by the Emperor Titus (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 79–81),
whenever twenty-four hours had passed without his having made
some valuable present to those about him. His courtiers were
ready to fall on their knees and hail him for his liberality as
‘Darling of the human race’; but he only reigned for two years.
Had he lived to exhaust his treasury it is probable that the
greedy throng would have passed a different verdict.</p>

<p>Extravagance is as catching as the plague, and the Roman
aristocracy did not fail to copy the imperial example. Just as
the Emperor was surrounded by a court, so every noble of
importance had his following of ‘clients’ who would wait submissively
on his doorstep in the morning and attend him when
he walked abroad to the Forum or the Public Baths. Some
would be idle gentlemen, the penniless younger sons of noble
houses, others professional poets ready to write flattering verses
to order, others again famous gladiators whose long death-roll of
victims had made them as popular in Rome as a champion tennis-player
or footballer in England to-day. All were united in the
one hope of gaining something from their patron, perhaps a gift
of money, or his influence to secure them a coveted office, at the
least an invitation to a banquet or feast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Roman Villa</div>

<p>The class of senators to which most of these aristocrats
belonged had grown steadily richer as the years of empire
increased, building up immense landed properties something like
the feudal estates of a later date. These ‘villas’, as they were
called, were miniature kingdoms over which their owners had
secured absolute power. Their affairs were administered by an
agent, probably a favoured slave who had gained his freedom,
assisted by a small army of officials. The principal subjects of
the landlord would be the small proprietors of farms who paid a
rent or did various services in return for their houses, while below
these again would be a larger number of actual slaves, employed
as household servants, bakers, shoe-makers, shepherds, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The most striking thing about the Roman ‘villa’ was that it
was absolutely self-contained. All that was needed for the life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
of its inhabitants, whether food or clothing, could be grown and
manufactured on the estate. The crimes that were committed
there would be judged by the master or his agent, and from the
former’s decision there would be little hope of appeal. Where
the proprietor was harsh or selfish, miserable indeed was the
condition of those condemned to live on his ‘villa’.</p>

<p>The income of the average senator in the fourth century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>
was about £60,000, a very large sum when money was not
as plentiful as it is to-day. Aurelius Symmachus, a young
senator typical of this time, possessed no less than fifteen
country seats, besides large estates in different parts of Italy
and three town houses in Rome or her suburbs. It was his object
to become Praetor of Rome, one of the highest offices in the
city; and in order to gain popularity he and his father organized
public games that cost them some £90,000. Lions and crocodiles
were fetched from Africa, dogs from Scotland, a special breed of
horses from Spain; while captured warriors were brought from
Germany, whom he destined to fight with one another in the
arena.</p>

<p>The life of this young senator, according to his letters, was
controlled by purely selfish considerations. He did not want
the praetorship in order to be of use to the Empire, but merely
that the Empire might crown his career with a coveted honour.
The same narrow outlook and lack of public spirit was common
to the majority of the other men and women of his class, and so
great was their blindness that they could not even see that they
were undermining Rome’s power, far less avail to save her.</p>

<p>More fatal even than the corruption of the aristocracy was the
decline of the middle classes, usually called the backbone of a
nation’s greatness. ‘The name of Roman citizen,’ says a native
of Marseilles in the fifth century, ‘formerly so highly valued and
even bought with a great price, is now ... shunned, nay it is
regarded with abomination.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Taxation under the Roman Empire</div>

<p>This change from the days of St. Paul may be traced back
long before the time when Symmachus wasted his patrimony in
bringing crocodiles from Africa and horses from Spain. Its cause
was the gradual but constant increase of taxation required to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
fill the imperial treasury, and the unequal scale according to
which such taxation was levied.</p>

<p>Rome’s main source of revenue was an impost on land, and
ought by rights to have been exacted from the senatorial class
that owned the majority of the large estates. Unfortunately, it
was left to the local municipal councils, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">curias</i>, to collect
this tax, and if it fell short of the amount required from the
locality by the imperial treasury, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">curiales</i>, or class compelled
as a duty to attend the councils, were held responsible for
the deficit.</p>

<p>Here was a problem for Roman citizens of medium wealth,
members of their <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">curia</i> by birth, quite unable to divest themselves
of this more than doubtful honour, and conscious that
their sons at eighteen must also accept the dignity and put their
shoulders to the burden. It was one thing to assess the chief
landlords of the neighbourhood at a sum that matched their
revenues, it was another to obtain the money from them. In
England to-day the man who refuses to pay his taxes is punished;
in imperial Rome it was the tax-collector.</p>

<p>Possessed of money and influence, it was not hard for a
senator to outwit mere <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">curiales</i>, either by obtaining an exemption
from the Emperor, or by bribing the occasional inspectors
sent by the central government to condone his refusal to pay.
The imperial court set an example of corruption, and those who
could imitate this example did so.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">curiales</i>, faced by ruin, sought relief in various ways.
Those with most wealth tried to raise themselves to senatorial
rank: others, unable to achieve this, yet conscious that they must
obtain the money required at all costs, demanded the heaviest
taxes from those who could not resist them, so that the phrase
spread abroad, ‘So many <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">curiales</i> just so many robbers.’</p>

<p>Less important members of the middle classes, unable to pay
their share of taxation or to force others to do so instead, tried
in every way to divest themselves of an honour grown intolerable,
and the legislation of the later Empire shows their efforts to
escape out of the net in which the government tried to hold them
enmeshed. Some sought the protection of the nearest landowners,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
and joined the dependants of their ‘villas’: others,
though forbidden by law, entered the army: while others again
sold themselves into slavery, since a master’s self-interest would
at least secure them food and clothing.</p>

<p>More desperate and adventurous spirits saw in brigandage a
means both of livelihood and of revenge. Joining themselves
to bands of criminals and escaped slaves, they infested the high
roads, waylaid and robbed travellers, and carried off their spoils
to mountain fastnesses. Thus, through fraud or violence, the
ranks of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">curiales</i> diminished, and taxation fell with still
heavier pressure on those who remained to support its burdens.</p>

<p>This evil state of affairs was intensified by the widespread
system of slavery that, besides its bad influence on the character
of both master and slave, had other economic defects. When
forced labour and free work side by side, the former will nearly
always drive the latter out of the market, because it can be
provided more cheaply. A master need not pay his slaves
wages; he can make them work as many hours as he chooses,
and lodge and feed them just as he pleases. From his point of
view it is more convenient to employ men who cannot leave his
service however much they dislike the work and conditions.
For these reasons business and trade tended to fall into the
hands of wealthy slave-owners who could undersell the employers
of free labour, and as the number of slaves increased the number
of free workmen grew less.</p>

<p>In Rome, and the large towns also, free labourers who
remained were corrupted like men and women of a higher rank
by the general extravagance and love of pleasure. They did
not agitate so much for a reform of taxation or the abolition of
slavery, but for larger supplies of free corn and more frequent
public games and spectacles.</p>

<p>An extravagant court, a corrupt government, slavery, class
selfishness, these were some of the principal causes of Rome’s
decline; but in recording them it must be remembered that the
taint was only gradual, like some corroding acid eating away
good metal. Not all <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">curiales</i>, in spite of popular assertions,
were robbers, not every taxpayer on the verge of starvation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
not every dependant of a ‘villa’ cowed and miserable. In many
houses masters would free or help their slaves, slaves be found
ready to die for their masters. The canker lay in the indifference
of individual Roman citizens to evils that did not touch them
personally, in the refusal to cure with radical reform even those
that did, in the foolish confidence of the majority in the glory of
the past as a safeguard for the present. ‘Faith in Rome killed
all faith in a wider future for humanity.’</p>

<p>This lack of vision has ruined many an empire and kingdom,
and Rome only half-opened her eyes even when the despised
barbarians who were to expose her weakness were already
knocking at the imperial gates.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>‘Barbarian’, we have noticed, was the epithet used by the
Roman of the early Empire to describe and condemn the person
not fortunate enough to share his citizenship.</p>

<p>At this time the most formidable of the barbarians were the
German tribes who inhabited large stretches of forest and
mountain land to the north of the Danube and east of the Rhine&mdash;a
tall, powerfully built race for the most part with ruddy hair
and fierce blue eyes, whose business was warfare, and the
occupation of their leisure hours the chase or gambling.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tacitus’ ‘Germania’</div>

<p>In his book, the <cite>Germania</cite>, Tacitus, a famous Roman historian
of the first century, describes these Teutons, and besides drawing
attention to their primitive customs and lack of culture, he
made copy of their simplicity to lash the vices of his own
countrymen.</p>

<p>The Germans, he said, did not live in walled towns but in
straggling villages standing amid fields. These were either
shared as common pasturage or tilled in allotments, parcelled
out annually amongst the inhabitants. A number of villages
would form a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pagus</i> or canton, a number of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pagi</i> a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">civitas</i>
or state. At the head of the state was more usually a king, but
sometimes only a number of important chiefs, or dukes, who
would be treated with the utmost reverence.</p>

<p>It was their place to preside over the small councils that dealt
with the less important affairs of the state, and to lay before the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
larger meeting of the tribe measures that seemed to require
public discussion. Lying round their camp fire in the moonlight
the younger men would listen to the advice of the more
experienced and clash their weapons as a sign of approval when
some suggestion pleased them.</p>

<p>At the councils were chosen the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">principes</i>, or magistrates,
whose duty it was to administer justice in the various cantons
and villages. Tribal law was very primitive in comparison with
the Roman code that required highly trained lawyers to interpret
it. Had a man betrayed his fellow villagers to their enemies,
let him be hung from the nearest tree that all might learn the
fitting reward of treachery. Had he turned coward and fled
from the battle, let him be buried in a morass out of sight beneath
a hurdle, that such shame should be quickly forgotten. Had
he in a rage or by accident slain or injured a neighbour, let him
pay a fine in compensation, half to his victim’s nearest relations,
half to the state. If the decision did not satisfy those concerned,
the family of the injured person could itself exact vengeance,
but since it would probably meet with opposition in so doing,
more bloodshed would almost certainly result, and a feud, like
the later Corsican <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">vendetta</i>, be handed down from generation to
generation.</p>

<p>Such a state of unrest had no horror for the German tribesman.
From his earliest days he looked forward to the moment when,
receiving from his kinsmen the gift of a shield and sword, he
might leave boyhood behind him and assume a man’s responsibilities
and dangers. With his comrades he would at once
hasten to offer his services to some great leader of his tribe, and
as a member of the latter’s <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">comitatus</i>, or following, go joyfully
out to battle.</p>

<p>Like the Spartan of old he went with the cry ringing in his
ears, ‘With your shield or on your shield!’</p>

<p>‘It is a disgrace’, says Tacitus, ‘for the chief to be surpassed
in battle ... and it is an infamy and a reproach for life to have
survived the chief and returned from the field.’</p>

<p>This statement explains the reckless daring with which the
scattered groups of Germans would fling themselves time after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
time against the disciplined Roman phalanxes. The women
shared the hardihood of the race, bringing and receiving as
wedding-gifts not ornaments or beautiful clothes but a warrior’s
horse, a lance, or sword.</p>

<p>‘Lest a woman should think herself to stand apart from
aspirations after noble deeds and from the perils of war, she is
reminded by the ceremony that inaugurates marriage that she is
her husband’s partner in toil and danger, destined to suffer and
die with him alike both in peace and war.’</p>

<p>Chaste, industrious, devoted to the interests of husband and
children, yet so patriotic that, watching the battle, she would
urge them rather to perish than retreat, the barbarian woman
struck Tacitus as a living reproach to the many faithless, idle,
pleasure-seeking wives and mothers of Rome in his own day.
The German tribes might be uncouth, their armies without
discipline, even their nobles ignorant of culture, but they were
brave, hospitable, and loyal. Above all they held a distinction
between right and wrong: they did not ‘laugh at vice’.</p>

<p>It is probable that in the days of Tacitus his views were
received throughout the Roman Empire with an amused shrug
of the shoulders, for to many the Germans were merely good
fighters, whose giant build added considerably to the glory of a
triumphal procession, when they walked sullenly in their shackles
behind the Victor’s car. With the passing of the years into
centuries, however, intercourse changed this attitude, and much
of the contempt on one side and hatred on the other vanished.</p>

<p>Germans captured in childhood were brought up in Roman
households and grew invaluable to their masters: numbers
were freed and remained as citizens in the land of their captivity.
The tribes along the borders became more civilized: they
exchanged raw produce or furs in the nearest Roman markets
for luxuries and comforts, and as their hatred of Rome disappeared
admiration took its place. Something of the greatness
of the Empire touched their imagination: they realized for the
first time the possibilities of peace under an ordered government;
and whole tribes offered their allegiance to a power that knew
not only how to conquer but to rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Emperors, nothing loath, gathered these new forces under
their standards as auxiliaries or allies (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">foederati</i>), and Franks
from Flanders, at the imperial bidding, drove back fellow
barbarians from the left bank of the Rhine; while fair-haired
Alemanni and Saxons fell in Caesar’s service on the plains of
Mesopotamia or on the arid sands of Africa. From auxiliary
forces to the ranks of the regular army was an easy stage, the
more so as the Roman legions were every year in greater need
of recruits as the boundaries of the Empire spread.</p>

<p>It is at first sight surprising to find that the military profession
was unpopular when we recall that it rested in the hands of the
legions to make or dispossess their rulers; but such opportunities
of acquiring bribes and plunder did not often fall to the lot of
the ordinary soldier, while the disadvantages of his career were
many.</p>

<p>A very small proportion of the army was kept in the large
towns of the south, save in Rome that had its own Praetorian
Guards: the majority of the legions defended the Rhine and
Danube frontiers, or still worse were quartered in cold and
foggy Britain, shut up in fortress outposts like York or Chester.
English regiments to-day think little of service in far-distant
countries like Egypt or India, indeed men are often glad to have
the experience of seeing other lands; but the Roman soldier as
he said farewell to his Italian village knew in his heart that it
had practically passed out of his life. The shortest period of
military service was sixteen years, the longest twenty-five; and
when we remember that, owing to the slow and difficult means
of transport, leave was impossible we see the Roman legionary
was little more than the serf of his government, bound to
spend all the best years of his life defending less warlike
countrymen.</p>

<p>Moving with his family from outpost to outpost, the memories
of his old home would grow blurred, and the legion to which he
belonged would occupy the chief place in his thoughts. As he
grew older his sons, bred in the atmosphere of war, would enlist
in their turn, and so the military profession would tend to
become a caste, handed down from father to son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
The soldier could have little sympathy with fellow citizens
whose interests he did not share, but would despise them
because they did not know how to use arms. The civilians, on
their side, would think the soldier rough and ignorant, and
forget how much they were dependent on his protection for their
trade and pleasure. Instead of trying to bridge this gulf, the
government, in their terror of losing taxpayers, widened it by
refusing to let <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">curiales</i> enlist. At the same time they filled up
the gaps in the legions with corps of Franks, Germans, or Goths;
because they were good fighting material, and others of their
tribe had proved brave and loyal.</p>

<p>In the same way, when land in Italy fell out of cultivation,
the Emperor would send numbers of barbarians as <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">coloni</i> or
settlers to till the fields and build themselves homes. At first
they might be looked on with suspicion by their neighbours, but
gradually they would intermarry and their sons adopt Roman
habits, until in time their descendants would sit in municipal
councils, and even rise to become Praetors or Consuls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Barbarian Invasions</div>

<p>When it is said that the Roman Empire fell because of the
inroads of barbarians, the impression sometimes left on people’s
minds is that hordes of uncivilized tribes, filled with contempt
for Rome’s luxury and corruption, suddenly swept across the
Alps in the fifth century, laying waste the whole of North Italy.
This is far from the truth. The peaceful invasion of the Empire
by barbarians, whether as slaves, traders, soldiers, or colonists,
was a continuous movement from early imperial days. There
is no doubt that, as it increased, it weakened the Roman power
of resistance to the actually hostile raids along the frontiers that
began in the second and third centuries and culminated in the
collapse of the imperial government in the West in the fifth.
An army partly composed of half-civilized barbarian troops
could not prove so trustworthy as the well-disciplined and
seasoned Romans of an earlier age; for the foreign element
was liable in some gust of passion to join forces with those of its
own blood against its oath of allegiance.</p>

<p>As to the main cause of the raids, it was rather love of Rome’s
wealth than a sturdy contempt of luxury that led these barbarians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
to assault the dreaded legions. Had it been mere love of
fighting, the Alemanni would as soon have slain their Saxon
neighbours as the imperial troops; but nowhere save in Spain,
or southern Gaul, or on the plains of Italy could they hope to find
opulent cities or herds of cattle. Plunder was their earliest
rallying cry; but in the third century the pressure of other
tribes on their flank forced them to redouble in self-defence
efforts begun for very different reasons.</p>

<p>This movement of the barbarians has been called ‘the
Wandering of the Nations’. Gradually but surely, like a stream
released from some mountain cavern, Goths from the North
and Huns and Vandals from the East descended in irresistible
numbers on southern Germany, driving the tribes who were
already in possession there up against the barriers, first of the
Danube and then of the Alps and Rhine.</p>

<p>Italy and Gaul ceased to be merely a paradise for looters, but
were sought by barbarians, who had learned something of
Rome’s civilization, as a refuge from other barbarians who trod
women and children underfoot, leaving a track wherever their
cruel hordes passed red with blood and fire. With their coming,
Europe passed from the brightness of Rome into the ‘Dark Ages’.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="III"></a>III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE DAWN OF CHRISTIANITY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When Augustus became Emperor of Rome, Jesus Christ was
not yet born. With the exception of the Jews, who believed in
the one Almighty ‘Jehovah’, most of the races within the
boundaries of the Empire worshipped a number of gods; and
these, according to popular tales, were no better than the men
and women who burned incense at their altars, but differed
from them only in being immortal, and because they could yield
to their passions and desires with greater success.</p>

<p>The Roman god ‘Juppiter’, who was the same as the Greek
‘Zeus’, was often described as ‘King of gods and men’; but
far from proving himself an impartial judge and ruler, the legends
in which he appears show him cruel, faithless, and revengeful.
‘Juno’, the Greek ‘Hera’, ‘Queen of Heaven’, was jealous
and implacable in her wrath, as the ‘much-enduring’ hero,
Ulysses, found when time after time her spite drove him from
his homeward course from Troy. ‘Mercury’, the messenger of
the gods, was merely a cunning thief.</p>

<p>Most of the thoughtful Greeks and Romans, it is true, came
to regard the old mythology as a series of tales invented by their
primitive ancestors to explain mysterious facts of nature like fire,
thunder, earthquakes. Because, however, this form of worship
had played so great a part in national history, patriotism dictated
that it should not be forgotten entirely; and therefore emperors
were raised to the number of the gods; and citizens of Rome,
whether they believed in their hearts or no, continued to burn
incense before the altars of Juppiter, Juno, or Augustus in token
of their loyalty to the Empire.</p>

<p>The human race has found it almost impossible to believe in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
nothing, for man is always seeking theories to explain his higher
nature and why it is he recognizes so early the difference
between right and wrong. Far back in the third and fourth
centuries before Christ, Greek philosophers had discussed the
problem of the human soul, and some of them had laid down
rules for leading the best life possible.</p>

<p>Epicurus taught that since our present life is the only one,
man must make it his object to gain the greatest amount of
pleasure that he can. Of course this doctrine gave an opening
to people who wished to live only for themselves; but Epicurus
himself had been simple, almost ascetic in his habits, and had
clearly stated that although pleasure was his object, yet ‘we can
not live pleasantly without living wisely, nobly, and righteously’.
The self-indulgent man will defeat his own ends by ruining his
health and character until he closes his days not in pleasure but
in misery.</p>

<p>Another Greek philosopher was Zeno, whose followers were
called ‘Stoics’ from the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">stoa</i> or porch of the house in Athens
in which he taught his first disciples. Zeno believed that man’s
fortune was settled by destiny, and that he could only find true
happiness by hardening himself until he grew indifferent to his
fate. Death, pain, loss of friends, defeated ambitions, all these
the Stoic must face without yielding to fear, grief, or passion.
Brutus, the leader of the conspirators who slew Julius Caesar,
was a Stoic, and Shakespeare in his tragedy shows the self-control
that Brutus exerted when he learned that his wife Portia whom
he loved had killed herself.</p>

<p>The teaching of Epicurus and Zeno did something during the
Roman Empire to provide ideals after which men could strive,
but neither could hold out hopes of a happiness without end or
blemish. The ‘Hades’ of the old mythology was no heaven but
a world of shades beyond the river Styx, gloomy alike for good
and bad. At the gates stood the three-headed monster Cerberus,
ready to prevent souls from escaping once more to light and
sunshine.</p>

<p>Paganism was thus a sad religion for all who thought of the
future: and this is one of the reasons why the tidings of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Christianity were received so joyfully. When St. Paul went
to Athens he found an altar set up to ‘the unknown God’, showing
that men and women were out of sympathy with their old beliefs
and seeking an answer to their doubts and questions. He tried
to tell the Greeks that the Christ he preached was the God they
sought; but those who heard him ridiculed the idea that a
Jewish peasant who had suffered the shameful death of the cross
could possibly be divine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early Christianity</div>

<p>The earliest followers of Christianity were not as a rule
cultured people like the Athenians, but those who were poor and
ignorant. To them Christ’s message was one of brotherhood
and love overriding all differences between classes and nations.
Yet it did not merely attract because it promised immortality and
happiness; it also set up a definite standard of right and wrong.
The Jewish religion had laid down the Ten Commandments as
the rule of life, but the Jews had never tried to persuade other
nations to obey them&mdash;rather they had jealously guarded their
beliefs from the Gentiles. The Christians on the other hand
had received the direct command ‘to go into all the world and
preach the Gospel to every creature’; and even the slave, when
he felt within himself the certainty of his new faith, would be
sure to talk about it to others in his household. In time the
strange story would reach the ears of his master and mistress,
and they would begin to wonder if what this fellow believed so
earnestly could possibly be true.</p>

<p>In a brutal age, when the world was largely ruled by physical
force, Christianity made a special appeal to women and to the
higher type of men who hated violence. One argument in its
favour amongst the observant was the life led by the early
Christians&mdash;their gentleness, their meekness, and their constancy.
It is one thing to suffer an insult through cowardice, quite
another to bear it patiently and yet be brave enough to face
torture and death rather than surrender convictions. Christian
martyrs taught the world that their faith had nothing in it mean
or spiritless.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may seem strange that men and women whose conduct
was so quiet and inoffensive should meet with persecution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
at all. Christ had told His disciples to ‘render unto Caesar the
things that are Caesar’s’, and the strength of Christianity lay
not in rebellion to the civil government but in submission. This
is true, yet the Christian who paid his taxes and took care to
avoid breaking the laws of his province would find it hard all
the same to live at peace with pagan fellow citizens. Like the
Jew he could not pretend to worship gods whom he considered
idols: he could not offer incense at the altars of Juppiter and
Augustus: he could not go to a pagan feast and pour out a
libation of wine to some deity, nor hang laurel branches sacred
to the nymph Daphne over his door on occasions of public
rejoicing.</p>

<p>Such neglect of ordinary customs made him an object of
suspicion and dislike amongst neighbours who did not share his
faith. A hint was given here and there by mischief makers, and
confirmed with nods and whisperings, that his quietness was only
a cloak for evil practices in secret; and this grew into a rumour
throughout the Empire that the murder of newborn babies was
part of the Christian rites.</p>

<p>Had the Christians proved more pliant the imperial government
might have cleared their name from such imputations and
given them protection, but it also distrusted their refusal to
share in public worship. Lax themselves, the emperors were
ready to permit the god of the Jews or Christians a place
amongst their own deities; and they could not understand the
attitude of mind that objected to a like toleration of Juppiter or
Juno. The commandment ‘Thou shalt have none other gods
but me’ found no place in their faith, and they therefore
accused the Christians and Jews of want of patriotism, and used
them as scapegoats for the popular fury when occasion required.</p>

<p>In the reign of Nero a tremendous fire broke out in Rome
that reduced more than half the city to ruins. The Emperor,
who was already unpopular because of his cruelty and extravagance,
fearing that he would be held responsible for the
calamity, declared hastily that he had evidence that the fire was
planned by Christians; and so the first serious persecution of
the new faith began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Persecution of the Christians</div>

<p>Here is part of an account given by Tacitus, whose history of
the German tribes we have already noticed:</p>

<p>‘He, Nero, inflicted the most exquisite tortures on those men
who under the vulgar appellation of Christians were already
branded with deserved infamy.... They died in torments, and
their torments were embittered by insult and derision. Some
were nailed on crosses; others sewn up in the skins of wild
beasts and exposed to the fury of dogs; others again, smeared
over with combustible materials, were used as torches to illuminate
the darkness of the night. The gardens of Nero were destined
for this melancholy spectacle, which was accompanied with
a horse race and honoured with the presence of the Emperor.’</p>

<p>Tacitus was himself a pagan and hostile to the Christians, yet
he admits that this cruelty aroused sympathy. Nevertheless
the persecutions continued under different emperors, some of
them, unlike Nero, wise rulers and good men.</p>

<p>‘These people’, wrote the Spanish Emperor Trajan (98–117),
referring to the Christians, ‘should not be searched for, but if
they are informed against and convicted they should be punished.’</p>

<p>Marcus Aurelius (161–180) declared that those who acknowledged
that they were Christians should be beaten to death; and
during his reign men and women were tortured and killed on account
of their faith in every part of the Empire. The test required
by the magistrates was nearly always the same, that the accused
must offer wine and incense before the statue of the Emperor
and revile the name of Christ.</p>

<p>The motive that inspired these later emperors was not Nero’s
innate love of cruelty or desire of finding a scapegoat, but
genuine fear of a sect that grew steadily in numbers and wealth,
and that threatened to interfere with the ordinary worship of the
temples, so bound up with the national life.</p>

<p>In the reign of Trajan the Governor of Bithynia wrote to the
Emperor complaining that on account of the spread of Christian
teaching little money was now spent in buying sacrificial beasts.
‘Nor’, he added, ‘are cities alone permeated by the contagion of
this superstition, but villages and country parts as well.’</p>

<p>Emperors and magistrates were at first confident that, if only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
they were severe enough in their punishments, the new religion
could be crushed out of existence. Instead it was the imperial
government that collapsed while Christianity conquered Europe.</p>

<p>Very early in the history of Christianity the Apostles had
found it necessary to introduce some form of government into
the Church; and later, as the faith spread from country to
country, there arose in each province men who from their goodness,
influence, or learning, were chosen by their fellow
Christians to control the religious affairs of the neighbourhood.
These were called ‘Episcopi’, or bishops, from the Latin word
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Episcopus</i>, ‘an overseer’. Tradition claims that Peter was
the first bishop of the Church in Rome, and that during the reign
of Nero he was crucified for loyalty to the Christ he had formerly
denied.</p>

<p>To help the bishops a number of ‘presbyters’ or ‘priests’
were appointed, and below these again ‘deacons’ who should
undertake the less responsible work. The first deacons had
been employed in distributing the alms of the wealthier members
of the congregation amongst the poor; and though in early days
the sums received were not large, yet as men of every rank
accepted Christianity regardless of scorn or danger and made
offerings of their goods, the revenues of the Church began to
grow. The bishops also became persons of importance in the
world around them.</p>

<p>In time emperors and magistrates whose predecessors had
believed in persecution came to recognize that it was not an
advantage to the government, even a danger, and instead they
began to consult and honour the men who were so much trusted
by their fellow citizens. At last, in the fourth century, there
succeeded to the throne an emperor who looked on Christianity
not with hatred or dread, but with friendly eyes as a more
valuable ally than the paganism of his fathers. This was the
Emperor Constantine the Great.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="IV"></a>IV<br />

<span class="subhead">CONSTANTINE THE GREAT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Constantine the Great was born at a time when the Empire
was divided up between different emperors. His father,
Constantius Chlorus, ruled over Spain, Gaul, and Britain; and
when he died at York in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 306, Constantine his eldest son
succeeded to the government of these provinces. The new
Emperor, who was thirty-two years old, had been bred in
the school of war. He was handsome, brave, and capable, and
knew how to make himself popular with the legions under his
command without losing his dignity or letting them become
undisciplined.</p>

<p>When he had reigned a few years he quarrelled with his
brother-in-law Maxentius who was Emperor at Rome, and
determined to cross the Alps and drive him from his throne.
The task was difficult; for the Roman army, consisting of picked
Praetorian Guards, and regiments of Sicilians, Moors, and
Carthaginians, was quite four times as large as the invading
forces. Yet Constantine, once he had made his decision, did
not hesitate. He knew his rival had little military experience,
and that the corruption and luxury of the Roman court had not
increased either his energy or valour.</p>

<p>It is said also that Constantine believed that the God of the
Christians was on his side, for as he prepared for a battle on the
plains of Italy against vastly superior forces, he saw before him
in the sky a shining cross and underneath the words ‘By this
conquer!’ At once he gave orders that his legions should
place on their shields the sign of the cross, and with this same
sign as his banner he advanced to the attack. It was completely
successful, the Roman army fled in confusion, Maxentius was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
slain, and Constantine entered the capital almost unopposed.
The arch in Rome that bears his name celebrates this triumph.</p>

<p>Constantine was now Emperor of the whole of Western
Europe, and some years later, after a furious struggle with
Licinius the Emperor of the East, he succeeded in uniting all the
provinces of the Empire under his rule.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>The ROMAN EMPIRE<br />
  in the time of<br />Constantine the Great</p></div></div>

<p>This was a joyful day for Christians, for though Constantine
was not actually baptized until just before his death, yet,
throughout his reign, he showed his sympathy with the Christian
religion and did all in his power to help those who professed it.
He used his influence to prevent gladiatorial shows, abolished
the horrible punishment of crucifixion, and made it easier than
ever before for slaves to free themselves. When he could,
he avoided pagan rites, though as Emperor he still retained the
office of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pontifex Maximus</i>, or ‘High Priest’, and attended
services in the temples.</p>

<p>His mother, the Empress Helena, to whom he was devoted,
was a Christian; and one of the old legends describes her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and how she found and brought
back with her some wood from the cross on which Christ had
been crucified.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Growth of Christianity</div>

<p>Soon after Constantine conquered Rome he published the
famous ‘Edict of Milan’ that allowed liberty of worship to all
inhabitants of the Empire, whether pagans, Jews, or Christians.
The latter were no longer to be treated as criminals but as
citizens with full civil rights, while the places of worship and
lands that had been taken from them were to be restored.</p>

<p>Later, as Constantine’s interest in the Christians deepened, he
departed from this impartial attitude and showed them special
favours, confiscating some of the treasures of the temples and
giving them to the Church, as well as handing over to it sums of
money out of the public revenues. He also tried to free the
clergy from taxation, and allowed bishops to interfere with the
civil law courts.</p>

<p>Many of these measures were unwise. For one thing,
Christianity when it was persecuted or placed on a level with
other religions only attracted those who really believed in
Christ’s teaching. When it received material advantages, on the
other hand, the ambitious at once saw a way to royal favour and
their own success by professing the new beliefs. A false element
was thus introduced into the Church.</p>

<p>For another thing, few even of the sincere Christians could be
trusted not to abuse their privileges. The fourth century did
not understand toleration; and those who had suffered persecution
were quite ready as a rule to use compulsion in their turn
towards men and women who disagreed with them, whether
pagans or those of their own faith. Quite early in its history
the Church was torn by disputes, since much of its teaching had
been handed down by ‘tradition’, or word of mouth, and this
led to disagreement as to what Christ had really said or meant
by many of his words. At length the Church decided that it
would gather the principal doctrines of the ‘Catholic’ or
‘universal’ faith into a form of belief that men could learn and
recite. Thus the ‘Apostles’ Creed’ came into existence.</p>

<p>In spite of this definition of the faith controversy continued.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
At the beginning of the fourth century a dispute as to the exact
relationship of God the Father to God the Son in the doctrine of
the Trinity broke out between Arius, a presbyter of the Church
in Egypt, and the Bishop of Alexandria, the latter declaring that
Arius had denied the divinity of Christ. Partisans defended
either side, and the quarrel grew so embittered that an appeal
was made to the Emperor to give his decision.</p>

<p>Constantine was reluctant to interfere. ‘They demand my
judgement,’ he said, ‘who myself expect the judgement of Christ.
What audacity of madness!’ When he found, however, that
some steps must be taken if there was to be any order in the
Church at all, he summoned a Council to meet at Nicea
and consider the question, and thither came bishops and clergy
from all parts of the Christian world. The meetings were
prolonged and stormy; but the eloquence of a young Egyptian
deacon called Athanasius decided the case against Arius; and
the latter, refusing to submit to the decrees of the Council, was
proclaimed a heretic, or outlaw. The orthodox Catholics, that
is, the majority of bishops who were present, then drew up a new
creed to express their exact views, and this took its name from
the Council, and was called the ‘Nicene Creed’. In a revised
form it is still recited in all the Catholic churches of Christendom.</p>

<p>Arius, though defeated at the Council, succeeded in winning the
Emperor over to his views, and Constantine tried to persuade
the Catholics to receive him back into the Church. When this
suggestion met with refusal the Emperor, who now believed that
he had a right to settle ecclesiastical matters, was so angry that he
tried to install Arius in one of the churches of his new city
of Constantinople by force of arms. The orthodox bishop
promptly closed and barred the gates, and riots ensued that
were only ended by the death of Arius himself.</p>

<p>The schism, however, continued, and it may be claimed that
its bitterness had a considerable influence in deciding the future
of Europe by raising barriers between races that might otherwise
have become friends. Arianism, like orthodox Catholicism,
was full of the missionary spirit, and from its priests the
half-civilized tribes of Goths and Vandals learned the new faith.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
A Gothic bishop was present at the Council of Nicea, while
another, Ulfilas, who had studied Latin, Greek, and Hebrew at
Constantinople, afterwards translated a great part of the Bible
into his own tongue. This is the first-known missionary Bible;
and, though the original has disappeared, a copy made about a
century later is in a museum at Upsala, written in Gothic
characters in silver and gold on purple vellum.</p>

<p>The Goths regarded their Bible with deep awe, and carried it
with them on their wanderings, consulting it before they went
into battle. Like the Vandals, who had also been converted by
the Arians, they considered themselves true Christians; but the
orthodox Catholics disliked them as heretics almost more than
the pagans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early Monasticism</div>

<p>Constantine himself imbibed the spirit of fanaticism; and
when he became the champion of Arius, persecuted Athanasius,
who had been made Bishop of Alexandria, and compelled him to go
into exile. Athanasius went to Rome, where it is said that he was
at first ridiculed because he was accompanied by two Egyptian
monks in hoods and cowls. Western Europe had heard little
as yet of monasticism, though the Eastern Church had adopted
it for some time.</p>

<p>To the early Christians with their high ideals the world
around them seemed a wicked place, in which it was difficult for
them to lead a Christ-like life. They thought that by withdrawing
from an atmosphere of brutality and material pleasure, and
by giving themselves up to fasting and prayer, they would be
able more easily to fix their minds on God and so fit themselves
for Heaven. Sometimes they would go to desert places and live
as hermits in caves, perhaps without talking to a living person
for months or even years. Others who could not face such
loneliness would join a community of monks, dwelling together
under special rules of discipline. At fixed hours of the day and
night they would recite the services of the Church, and in between
whiles they would work or pray and study the Scriptures.</p>

<p>Many of the austerities they practised sound to us absurd, for
it is hard to feel in sympathy with a Simon Stylites who spent
the best days of his manhood crouched on a high pillar at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
mercy of sun, wind, and rain, until his limbs stiffened and
withered away. Yet the hermits and monks were an arresting
witness to Christianity in an age that had not fully realized what
Christ’s teaching meant. ‘He that will serve me let him take
up his cross and follow me.’ This ideal of sacrifice was brought
home for the first time to hundreds of thoughtless men and
women when they saw some one whom they knew give up his
worldly prospects and the joy of a home and children in order
to lead a life of perpetual discomfort until death should come to
him as a blessing not a curse. The majority of the leading
clergy in the early Church, the ‘Fathers of the Church’, as they
are usually called, were monks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Fathers of the Church</div>

<p>Two of them, St. Gregory and St. Basil, studied together at the
University of Athens in the fourth century. St. Basil founded
a community of monks in Asia Minor, where his reputation for
holiness soon drew together a large number of disciples. He
did not try to win them by fair words or the promise of ease and
comfort, for his monks were allowed little to eat and spent their
days in prayer and manual labour of the hardest kind. The
Arians, who hated St. Basil as an orthodox Catholic, once threatened
that they would confiscate his belongings, torture him, and put
him to death. ‘My sole wealth is a ragged cloak and some
books,’ replied the hermit calmly. ‘My days on earth are but
a pilgrimage, and my body is so feeble that it will expire at the
first torment. Death will be a relief.’ It came when he was
only fifty, but not at the hands of his enemies, for he died
exhausted by the penances and privations of his customary life.
He left many letters and theological works that throw light on
the religious questions of his day.</p>

<p>St. Gregory had lived for a time with St. Basil and his monks in
Asia Minor but was not strong enough to submit to the same harsh
discipline. Indeed he declared that but for the kindness of
St. Basil’s mother he would have died of starvation. Afterwards
he returned home and was ordained a priest. He was a gentler
type of man than St. Basil, a poet of no little merit and an eloquent
preacher.</p>

<p>Yet another of the Catholic ‘Fathers of the Church’ was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
St. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan. He was elected to this see against
his own will by the people of the town, who respected him
because he was strong and fearless. St. Ambrose did not hesitate
to use the wealth of the Church, even melting down some of the
altar-vessels, to ransom Christians who had been carried away
captive during one of the barbarian invasions. ‘The Church,’
he declared, ‘possesses gold and silver not to hoard, but to spend
on the welfare and happiness of men.’</p>

<p>The impetuosity and vigour that made him a born leader he
also employed to express his intolerance of those who disagreed
with him. When some Christians in Milan burned a Jewish
synagogue and the Emperor Theodosius ordered them to rebuild
it, St. Ambrose advised them not to do so. ‘I myself,’ he
said, ‘would have burned the synagogue.... What has been done
is but a trifling retaliation for acts of plunder and destruction
committed by Jews and heretics against the Catholics.’ This
was not the spirit of the Founder of Christianity: it was too
often the spirit of the mediaeval Church.</p>

<p>A man of even greater influence than St. Ambrose of Milan was
St. Jerome, a monk of the fifth century, who is chiefly remembered
to-day because of his Latin translation of the Bible, ‘the Vulgate’
as it is called, that is still the recognized edition of the Roman
Catholic Church.</p>

<p>St. Jerome was born in Italy, but in his extreme asceticism he
followed the practices of the Eastern rather than the Western
Church. As a youth he had led a wild life, but, suddenly
repenting, he disappeared to live as a hermit in the desert,
starving and mortifying himself. So strongly did he believe
that this was the only road to Heaven that when he went to
Rome he preached continually in favour of celibacy, urging men
and women not to marry, as if marriage had been a sin. He was
afraid that if they became happy and contented in their home life
they would forget God.</p>

<p>Many of the leading families, and especially their women,
came under St. Jerome’s influence, but such exaggerated views
could never be really popular and, instead of being chosen
Bishop of Rome as he had expected, he was forced, by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
many enemies he had aroused, to leave the town, and returned
once more to the desert. Of his sincerity there can be little doubt,
but his outlook on life was warped because, like so many good and
earnest contemporary Christians, he believed that human nature
and this earth were entirely bad and that only by the suppression
of any enjoyment in them could the soul obtain salvation.</p>

<p>Several centuries were to pass before St. Francis of Assisi
taught his fellow men the beauty and value of what is human.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foundation of Constantinople</div>

<p>Constantinople (the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Polis</i> or city of Constantine) had been
a Greek colony under the name of Byzantium long before Rome
existed. Built on the headland of the Golden Horn, its walls
were lapped by an inland sea whose depth and smoothness made
a splendid harbour from the rougher waters of the Mediterranean.
Almost impregnable in its fortifications, it frowned on
Asia across the narrow straits of the Hellespont and completely
commanded the entrance to the Black Sea, with its rich ports,
markets then as now for the corn and grain of southern Russia.</p>

<p>Constantine, when he decided that Byzantium should be his
capital, was well aware of these advantages. He had been born
in the Balkans, had spent a great part of his life as a soldier in
Asia, had assumed the imperial crown in Britain, and ruled
Gaul for his first kingdom. This medley of experience left little
place in his heart for Italy, and the name of Rome had no power
to stir his blood. Rome to him was a corrupt town in one of
the outlying limbs of his Empire: it had no harbour nor special
military value on land, while the Alps were a barrier preventing
news from passing quickly to and fro. Byzantium, on the other
hand, near the mouth of the Danube, was easy of access and yet
could be rendered almost impregnable to his foes. It had the
great military advantage also of serving as an admirable head-quarters
for keeping watch over the northern frontier and an
outlook towards the East.</p>

<p>The walls of the original town could not embrace the
Emperor’s ambitions, and he himself, wand in hand, designed
the boundaries. His court, following him, gasped with dismay.
‘It is enough,’ they urged; ‘no imperial city was ever so great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
before.’ ‘I shall go on,’ replied Constantine, ‘until he, the
invisible guide who marches before me, thinks fit to stop.’</p>

<p>Not until the seven hills outside Byzantium were enclosed
within his circuit was the Emperor satisfied; and then the great
work of building began, and the white marble of Forum and
Baths, of Palaces and Colonnades, arose to adorn the Constantinople
that has ever since this time played so large a part in the
history of Europe. In the new market-place, just beyond the
original walls, was placed the ‘Golden Milestone’, a marble
column within a small temple, bearing the proud inscription
that here was the ‘central point of the world’. Inside were
statues of Constantine and Queen Helena his mother, while
Rome herself and the cities of Greece were robbed of their masterpieces
of sculpture to embellish the buildings of the new capital.</p>

<p>In May <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 330 Constantinople was solemnly consecrated,
and the Empire kept high festival in honour of an event that few
of the revellers recognized would alter the whole course of her
destiny. The new capital, through her splendid strategic
position, was to preserve the imperial throne with one short
lapse for more than a thousand years, but this advantage was
obtained at the expense of Rome, and the complete severance of
the interests of the Empire in the East and West.</p>

<p>The Romans had never loved the Greeks, even when they
most admired their art and subtle intellect, and now in the fourth
century this persistent distrust was intensified when Greece
usurped the glory that had been her conqueror’s. In the
absence of an Emperor and of the many high officials who had
gone to swell the triumph of his new court, Rome set up another
idol. The symbols of material glory might vanish, but the
Christian faith had supplied men with fresh ideals through the
teaching of the Apostles and their representatives, the Bishops.</p>

<p>Roman bishops claimed that the gift of grace they received at
their consecration had been passed down to them by the successive
laying-on of hands from St. Peter himself. ‘Thou art Peter,
and on this rock I will build my Church ... and whatsoever
thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever
thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
These words of Christ seemed to grant to his apostle complete
authority over the souls of men; and Christians at Rome began
to ask if the power of St. Peter to ‘bind and loose’ had not been
handed down to his successors? If so <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Il Papa</i>, that is, ‘their
father’, the Pope, was undoubtedly the first bishop in Christendom,
for on no other apostle had Christ bestowed a like
authority.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that this reasoning came like a flash
of inspiration or was willingly received by all Christians. Many
generations of Popes, from the days of St. Peter onwards, were
regarded merely as Bishops of Rome, that is, as ‘overseers’ of
the Church in the chief city of the Empire. They were loved
and esteemed by their flock not on account of special divine
authority but because they stood neither for self-interest nor for
faction, but for principles of justice, mercy, and brotherhood.</p>

<p>Had a Roman been robbed by a fellow citizen, were there
a plague or famine, was the city threatened by enemies without
her walls, it was to her bishop Rome turned, demanding help
and protection. Afterwards it was only natural that the one
power that could and did afford these things when Emperors
and Senators were far away should in time take the Emperor’s
place, and that the Pope should appear to Rome, and gradually
as we shall see to Western Europe, God’s very viceroy on earth.</p>

<p>To the Church in Greece, Egypt, and Asia Minor he never
assumed this halo of glory. Byzantium, the great Constantinople,
was the pivot on which the eastern world turned, and the
Bishop of Rome with his tradition of St. Peter made no authoritative
appeal. Thus far back in the fourth century the cleft had
already opened between the Churches of the East and West that
was to widen into a veritable chasm.</p>

<p>Constantine ‘the Great’ died in 337, and if greatness be
measured by achievement he well deserves his title. Where
men of higher genius and originality had failed he had
succeeded, beating down with calm perseverance every object
that threatened his ambitions, until at last the Christian ruler of
a united empire, feared and respected by subjects and enemies
alike, he passed to his rest.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE INVASIONS OF THE BARBARIANS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Instead of endeavouring to maintain a united empire,
Constantine in his will divided up his dominions between three
sons and two nephews. Before thirty years were over, however,
a series of murders and civil wars had exterminated his family;
and two brothers, Valentian and Valens, men of humble birth
but capable soldiers, were elected as joint emperors. Valens
ruled at Constantinople, his brother at Milan; and it was during
this reign that the Empire received one of the worst blows that
had ever befallen her.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned the Goths, a race of barbarians
half-civilized by Roman influence and converted to Christianity
by followers of Arius. One of their tribes, the Visigoths, had
settled in large numbers in the country to the north of the Danube.
On the whole their relations with the Empire were friendly, and
it was hardly their fault that the peace was finally broken, but
rather of a strange Tartar race the Huns, that, massing in the
plains of Asia, had suddenly swept over Europe. Here is a
description given of the Huns by a Gothic writer: ‘Men with
faces that can scarcely be called faces, rather shapeless black
collops of flesh with tiny points instead of eyes: little in stature
but lithe and active, skilful in riding, broad-shouldered, hiding
under a barely human form the ferocity of a wild beast.’</p>

<p>Tradition says that these monsters, mounted on their shaggy
ponies, rode women and children under foot and feasted on human
flesh. Whether this be true or no, their name became a terror to
the civilized world, and after a few encounters with them the
Visigoths crowded on the edge of the Danube and implored the
Emperor to allow them to shelter behind the line of Roman forts.</p>

<p>Valens, to whom the petition was made, hesitated. There was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
obvious danger to his dominions in this sudden influx of a whole
tribe; but on the other hand fear might madden the Visigoths
into trying to cross even if he refused, and if so could he withstand
them?</p>

<p>‘All the multitude that had escaped from the murderous
savagery of the Huns,’ says a writer of the day, ‘no less than
200,000 fighting men besides women and old men and children,
were there on the river bank, stretching out their hands with
loud lamentations ... and promising that they would ever faithfully
adhere to the imperial alliance, if only the boon was granted
them.’</p>

<p>Reluctantly Valens yielded; and soon the province of Dacia
was crowded with refugees; but here the real trouble began.
Food must be found for this multitude, and it was evident that the
local crops would not suffice. In vain the Emperor commanded
that corn should be imported: the greed of officials who were
responsible for carrying out this order led them to hold up large
consignments, and to sell what little they allowed to pass at wholly
extortionate rates. Their unwelcome guests, half-starved and
fleeced of the small savings they had been able to bring with
them, complained, plotted, and broke at last into open rebellion.</p>

<p>This treatment of the Visigoths in Dacia is one of the worst
pages in the history of the Roman Empire, but it brought its own
speedy punishment. The suspicion and hatred engendered by
misery spread like a flame, and the barbarian forces were joined
by deserters of their own race from the imperial legions and by
runaway slaves until they had grown into a formidable army.
Valens, forced to take steps to preserve his throne, met them on
the battle-field of Adrianople, but only to suffer crushing defeat.
He himself was slain, and some 40,000 of those who had served
under his banner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Emperor Theodosius</div>

<p>Never before had the imperial eagles met with such a reverse
at barbarian hands, and the Visigoths after the first moment of
triumph were almost alarmed at the extent of their own success.
Before the frowning walls of Constantinople their courage
faltered, and without attempting a siege they retreated northwards
into Thrace. Gladly they came to terms with Theodosius,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Valens’s successor, who, not content with regranting them the
lands to the south of the Danube that they so much desired,
increased his army by taking whole regiments of their best
warriors into his pay.</p>

<p>‘Lover of peace and of the Goths’ is the character with which
Theodosius has passed down to posterity, and during his reign
the Visigoths and other northern tribes received continual marks
of his favour.</p>

<p>One of the Gothic kings, the old chief Athanaric, went to visit
him at Constantinople, and was overwhelmed by the magnificence
and luxury he saw around him. ‘Now do I at last behold,’ he
exclaimed, ‘what I have often heard but deemed incredible....
Doubtless the Emperor is a God on earth, and he who raises a
hand against him is guilty of his own blood.’</p>

<p>The alliance between Goth and Greek served its purpose at
the moment, for by the aid of his new troops Theodosius was able
to defeat the rival Emperor of Rome and to conquer Italy.
When he died he left Constantinople and the East to his eldest
son Arcadius, a youth of eighteen, and Rome and the West to
the younger, Honorius, who was only eleven. True to his belief
in barbarian ability, Theodosius selected a Vandal chief, Stilicho,
to whom he had given his niece in marriage, that he might act as
the boy’s adviser and command the imperial forces.</p>

<p>Under a wise regent a nation may wait in patience for their child
ruler to mature. Unfortunately, Honorius, as he grew up, belied
any promise of manliness he had ever shown, languidly refusing
to continue his boyish sports of riding or archery, and taking no
interest save in some cocks and hens that it was his daily pleasure
to feed himself. He had no affection or reverence for Rome, and
finally settled in Ravenna on the Adriatic as the safest fortress
in his dominions. From here he consented to sign the orders
that dispatched the legions to protect his frontiers, or issued
haughty manifestoes to his enemies.</p>

<p>So long as Stilicho lived such feebleness passed comparatively
unnoticed; for the Vandal, a man of giant build and strength,
possessed to the full the tireless energy and daring that the
dangers of the time demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Theodosius had made the Visigoths his friends; but on his
death they began to chafe at the restrictions laid upon them by
the imperial alliance. Arcadius was nearly as poor a creature as
his younger brother, ‘so inactive that he seldom spoke and always
looked as though he were about to fall asleep.’ The barbarians
bore him no hatred, but on the other hand he could scarcely
inspire their affection or fear, and so they chose a king of their
own, Alaric, one of their most famous generals, and from this
moment they began to think of fresh conquests and pillage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visigothic Invasion</div>

<p>The suggestion of sacking Constantinople was put on one side.
Those massive walls against their background of sea would make
it a difficult task; besides, the Visigoths argued, were there not
other towns equally rich and more vulnerable? With an
exultant shout that answered this question they set out on their
march first towards Illyricum on the eastern coast of the
Adriatic, and then to the fertile plains of Italy.</p>

<p>Alaric and Stilicho were well matched as generals, and for
years, through arduous campaigns of battles and sieges, the
Vandal kept the Goth at bay. When at last death forced him
to resign the challenge, it was no enemy’s sword but the weapon
of treachery that robbed Rome of her best defender.</p>

<p>Honorius, lacking in gratitude as in other virtues, had been
ill pleased at the success of his armies; for wily courtiers, hoping
to plant their fortunes amid another’s ruin, told him that Stilicho
intended to secure the imperial throne for himself and that in order
to do so he would think little of murdering his royal master.
Suspicion made the timid Emperor writhe with terror through
sleepless nights. It seemed to him that he would never know
peace of mind again until he had rid himself of his formidable
commander-in-chief; and so by his orders Stilicho was put
to death and Italy lay at the mercy of Alaric and his followers.</p>

<p>Sweeping across the Alps, the Visigoths paused at last before
the gates of Rome. ‘We are many in number and prepared to
fight,’ boldly began the ambassadors sent out from the city.
‘Thick grass is easier to mow than thin,’ replied Alaric.</p>

<p>Dropping their lofty tone, the ambassadors demanded the
price of peace, and on the answer, ‘Your gold and silver, your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
treasures, all that you have,’ they exclaimed in horror, ‘What then
do you leave us?’ ‘Your souls,’ was the mocking rejoinder.</p>

<p>After much argument the Visigoths consented to be bought
off and retreated northwards, but it was only to return in the
summer of the year 410, when Rome after a feeble resistance
opened her gates. Her enemies poured in triumph through the
streets; but Alaric was no Hun loving slaughter for its own
sake, and ordered his troops to respect human life and to spare
the churches and the gold and silver vessels that rested on
their altars.</p>

<p>He spent only a few days in sacking the city and then
marched southwards, intending to invade Africa. While his
army was embarking, however, he fell ill and died, and so great
was his loss that all thought of the campaign was surrendered.
Alaric was mourned by his people as a national hero, and, unable
to bear the thought that his enemies might one day
desecrate his tomb, they dammed up a river in the neighbourhood,
and dug a grave for their general deep in its bed. When
they had laid his body there, they released the stream into its
old course, and so left their hero safe from insult beneath the
waters.</p>

<p>The sack of Rome that moved the civilized world profoundly
made little impression upon the young Emperor. He had
named one of his favourite hens after the capital; and when
a messenger, haggard with the news he had brought, fell on his
knees, gasping, ‘Sire, Rome has perished,’ Honorius only
frowned, and replied, ‘Impossible! I fed her myself this
morning.’</p>

<p>St. Jerome, in his hermit’s cell at Bethlehem, was stupefied at
the fate of the ‘Eternal City’. ‘The world crumbles,’ he said.
‘There is no created work that rust or age does not consume:
but Rome! Who could have believed that, raised by her
victories above the universe, she would one day fall?’</p>

<p>Why had Rome fallen? This was the question on everybody’s
lips. We know to-day that the process of her corruption
had been working for centuries; but men and women rarely see
what is going on around them, and some began to murmur that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
the old gods of Olympus were angry because their religion had
been forsaken. It was affirmed that Christ would save the
world, but what had He done to save Rome?</p>

<p>Christianity was not long in finding a champion to defend her
cause&mdash;an African monk, Augustine, to mediaeval minds the
greatest of all the ‘Fathers of the Church’. Augustine was the
son of a pagan father and a Christian mother and grew up
a wild and undisciplined boy. After some years at the University
of Carthage, spent in casual study and habitual dissipation, he determined
to go to Rome, and from there passed to Milan, where he
went out of curiosity to listen to the preaching of St. Ambrose.
It was obvious that he would either hate or be strongly
influenced by this fiery old man; and in truth Augustine,
who secretly repented of the way he had wasted his life, was in
a ripe mood to receive the message that he had refused to hear
from the lips of Monica his mother. Soon he was converted
and baptized, and later he was made Bishop of Hippo, a place
not far from Carthage.</p>

<p>It is difficult to give a picture of Augustine in a few words.
Like St. Ambrose and others of the early ‘Fathers’ he was quite
intolerant of heresy and believed that ordinary human love and
the simplest pleasures of the world were snares set by the devil
to catch the unwary; but against these unbalanced views, largely
the product of the age in which he lived, must be set his burning
enthusiasm for God, and the services that he rendered to
Christianity.</p>

<p>A modern writer says of him, ‘As the supreme man of his
time he summed up the past as it still lived, remoulded it, added
to it from himself, and gave it a new unity and form wherein it
was to live on.... The great heart, the great mind, the mind
led by the heart’s inspiration, the heart guided by the mind&mdash;this
is Augustine.’</p>

<p>Superior in intellect to other men of his day, his whole being
filled with the love of God and fired by the desire to make the
world share his worship, he preached, worked, and wrote only
to this end. In his <cite>Confessions</cite> he describes his youth and
repentance; but his most famous work is his <cite>Civitas Dei</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Here was the answer to those who declared that Rome had
fallen because she neglected her pagan deities. Rome, he
maintained, was not and never could be eternal; for the one
eternal kingdom was the <cite>Civitas Dei</cite>, or ‘City of God’,
towards whose reign of triumph the human race had been
tending since earliest times. Before her glory the kingdoms of
this world, and all the culture and civilization of which men
boasted, must fade away. Thus God had destined; and
St. Augustine exerted all his eloquence and powers of reasoning
to prove from history the magnitude and sureness of the divine
purpose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vandal Invasion</div>

<p>The author of the <cite>Civitas Dei</cite> was to have his faith severely
tested, for he died amid scenes of desolation and horror that
held out no hope of happiness for man on earth. Rome stood
at the mercy of barbarians, and Christian Africa was also fast
falling under their yoke. These new invaders, the Vandals,
were also a German tribe, who, as soon as Stilicho withdrew
legions from the Rhine to defend Italy from the Visigoths,
broke over the weakened frontier into Gaul, and from there
crossed the Pyrenees and marched southwards.</p>

<p>Spain had been one of the richest of Rome’s provinces, and
besides her minerals and corn had provided the Empire with not
a few rulers as well as famous authors and poets. In her commercial
prosperity she had grown, like her neighbours, corrupt
and unwarlike, so that the Vandals met with little resistance and
plundered and pillaged at their will. Instead of settling down
amid their conquests they were driven by the promise of further
loot and the pressure of other barbarian tribes following hard on
their heels to cross the narrow Strait of Gibraltar and to pursue
their way due east along the African coast. In Spain they have
left the memory of their presence in the name of one of her
fairest provinces, Andalusia.</p>

<p>The chief of the Vandals at this time was Genseric, who not
only conquered all the coast-line of North Africa, but also built
a fleet that became the terror of the Mediterranean. Like the
Goths the Vandals were Christians, but they held the views of
Arius and there could be little hope that they would tolerate the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
orthodox Catholics. Though hardly as inhuman and ruthless
as their opponents would have had the world believe, they pillaged
and laid waste as they passed; and posterity has since applied
the word <em>vandal</em> to the man who wilfully destroys.</p>

<p>The name ‘Hun’ is of even more sinister repute. In the first
half of the fifth century the Huns in their triumphant march
across Europe were led by their king, Attila, ‘the Scourge of
God’, whose boast it was that never grass grew again where his
horse’s hoofs had once trod. So short and squat as to be almost
deformed, flat-nosed, with a swarthy skin and deep-set eyes,
that he would roll hideously when angered, the King loved to
inspire terror not only amongst his enemies but in the chieftains
under his command. Pity, gentleness, civilization, such words
were either unknown or abhorrent to him; and in the towns
whose walls were stormed by his troops, old men, women,
priests, and children fell alike victims to his sword.</p>

<p>It was his ambition that the name of ‘Attila’ should become a
terror to the whole earth, but the extent to which he succeeded
in realizing this aim brought a serious check to his arms; for
when he reached the boundaries of Gaul, he found that fear had
gathered into a single hostile force of formidable size races that
had warred for centuries amongst themselves. Here were not
only ‘Provincials’, descendants of the Romanized inhabitants
of Gaul, but Goths, Franks, Burgundians, and other tribes who,
like the Vandals, had forced the passage of the Rhine as soon
as the imperial garrisons were weakened or withdrawn. They
had little in common save hatred of the Hun, a passion so
strong that in a desperate battle on the plain of Chalons they
hurled back the Tartar hordes for ever from the lands of
Western Europe.</p>

<p>Shaken by his defeat, but sullen and vindictive, Attila turned
his thoughts to Italy; and he and his warriors swept across the
passes of the Alps and descended on the fertile country lying to
the north-west of the Adriatic. The Italians made but a feeble
resistance, and the palaces, baths, and amphitheatres of once
wealthy towns vanished in smoking ruins.</p>

<p>One important work of construction Attila unconsciously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
assisted, for the inhabitants of Aquileia, seeking a refuge from
their cruel foe, fled to the coast, and there amid the desolate
lagoons they and their descendants built for themselves in the
course of centuries a new city, Venice, the future ‘Queen of the
Adriatic’. Aquileia had been a city of repute, but it can be
safely guessed that she would never have attained the world-wide
glory that Venice, safe behind her barrier of marshes and
with every incentive to naval enterprise, was to establish in the
Middle Ages.</p>

<p>From the Adriatic provinces Attila passed to Rome, but
refrained from sacking the city. It is said that he was uneasy
because the armies of Gaul that had defeated him at Chalons
still hung on his rear, threatening to cut off his retreat across
the Alps. At any rate, he consented to make terms negotiated
by the Pope on behalf of the citizens of Rome. Contemporary
accounts declare that the Hun was awed by the sight of Leo I
in his priestly robes and by the fearlessness of his bearing, and
certainly for his mediation he well deserved the title of ‘Great’
that the people in their gratitude bestowed on him.</p>

<p>Attila, when he left Rome, turned northwards, but died quite
shortly after some drunken orgy. The kingdom of massacre
and fire that he had built on the terror of his name fell rapidly
to pieces, and only the remembrance of that terror remained;
while Huns merged themselves in the armies of other tribes or
fought together in petty rivalry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vandal Sack of Rome</div>

<p>Rome had been taken by Alaric the Visigoth and spared by
Attila, but her trials were not yet at an end. Genseric, the
Vandal king, who had established himself at Carthage, was only
awaiting his opportunity to plunder a city that was still a world-famous
treasure house. His fleet, that had cut off Italy entirely
from the cornfields of Egypt, blockaded the mouth of the Tiber,
and the Romans, weakened by famine and the warfare of the
past few years, quickly sued for peace.</p>

<p>Once more Pope Leo went as mediator to the camp of his
enemies; but the Arian Vandal, unlike the pagan Hun, was
adamant. He was willing to forgo a general massacre but
nothing further, and for a fortnight the city was ruthlessly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
pillaged. Then Genseric sailed away, carrying with him
thousands of prisoners besides all the treasures of money and
art on which he could lay hands. Nearly four hundred years
before, the Emperor Titus, when he sacked Jerusalem, brought
to Rome the golden altar and candlesticks of the Jewish Temple,
and now Rome in her turn was despoiled of these trophies of
her former victories.</p>

<p>It was little wonder if the Western emperors, who had
systematically failed to save their capital, became discredited at
last among their own troops, and Rome, that had begun life according
to tradition under a ‘Romulus’, was to end her Empire under
another, a handsome boy, nicknamed in derision of his helplessness
‘Augustulus’, or ‘little Augustus’.</p>

<p>The pretext of his deposition was his refusal to grant Italian
lands to the German troops who formed the main part of the
imperial army, on which their captain, Odoacer, compelled him
to abdicate. So low had the imperial dignity sunk in public
estimation that Odoacer, instead of claiming the once-coveted
honour, sent the diadem and purple robe to the Emperor at
Constantinople. ‘We disclaim the necessity or even the wish’,
wrote Augustulus, ‘of continuing any longer the imperial
succession in Italy.... The majesty of a sole monarch is sufficient
to pervade and protect at the same time both East and West.’</p>

<p>The writer, so fortunate in his insignificance that no one
wished to assassinate him, spent the rest of his days in a castle
by the Mediterranean, supported by a revenue from the state;
while Odoacer, with the title of ‘Patrician’, ruled the land with
statesmanlike moderation for fourteen years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ostrogothic Invasion</div>

<p>Two more waves of invasion were yet to break across the
Alps and hinder all attempts at restoration and unity. The first
was that of the ‘Ostrogoths’, or ‘Eastern’ Goths, a tribe of the
same race as the Visigoths that, meeting the first onslaught of
the Huns in their advance from Asia, had only just on the death
of Attila freed themselves from this terrible yoke. They sought
now an independent kingdom, and under the leadership of their
prince, Theodoric, chafed on the boundaries of the Eastern
Empire, with which they had formed an alliance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Theodoric had been educated in Constantinople, and though
brave and warlike did not share the reckless love of battle that
animated his followers. He realized, however, that he must
lead the Ostrogoths to a new land of plenty or incur their
hatred and suspicion, so he appealed to the Emperor Zeno for
leave to go to Italy as his general and depose Odoacer.
‘Direct me with the soldiers of my nation,’ he wrote, ‘to march
against the tyrant. If I fall you will be relieved from an
expensive and troublesome friend; if, with divine permission,
I succeed, I shall govern in your name and to your glory.’</p>

<p>Zeno had not been sufficiently powerful to prevent Odoacer
from taking the title of ‘Patrician’, but he had never liked the
‘barbarian upstart’ who had dared to depose an emperor. He
had also begun to dread the presence of the restless Ostrogoths
so close to Constantinople, and warmly appreciated Theodoric’s
arguments in favour of their exodus. If the two barbarian
kings destroyed one another, it would be all the better for the
Empire, and so with the imperial blessing Theodoric started on
his great adventure.</p>

<p>He took with him not only his warriors but the women and
children of his tribe and all their possessions; and after several
battles succeeded in defeating and slaying his opponent. Rome,
that looked upon him as the Emperor’s representative, joyfully
opened her gates, but Theodoric preferred to make Ravenna his
capital, and here he settled and planted an orchard with his own
hands.</p>

<p>It was his hope that he might win the trust and affection
of his new subjects, and, though he ruled exactly as he liked,
he remained outwardly submissive to the Emperor, writing him
humble letters and marking the coinage with the imperial stamp.
He frequently consulted the Senate at Rome that, though it had
long ago lost any real power, had never ceased to take a nominal
share in the government; and when he gave a third of the
Italian lands to his own countrymen he allowed Roman
officials to make the division.</p>

<p>Theodoric also maintained the laws and customs of Italy and
forced the Ostrogoths to respect them too; but his army<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
remained a national bodyguard, and in spite of his efforts at
conciliation the two peoples did not mingle. Between them
stood the barrier of religious bitterness, for the Ostrogoths were
Arians, and, though their ruler was very tolerant in his attitude,
the Catholics were always suspicious of his intentions.</p>

<p>On one occasion there had been a riot against the Jews and
several synagogues had been burned. Theodoric ordered
a collection of money to be made amongst the orthodox
Catholics who were responsible, that the buildings might be
restored. This command was disobeyed, and when the ring-leaders
of the strike were whipped through the streets, popular
anger against the Gothic king grew to white heat. He himself
changed in character as he became older and showed himself
morose and tyrannical. Towards the end of his reign he put to
death Boethius, a Roman senator, who had been one of his
favourite advisers, but who had dared to defend openly a man
whom he himself had condemned.</p>

<p>Boethius was not only a fearless champion of his friends&mdash;he
was a great scholar who had kept alight the torch of classical
learning amid the darkness and horror of invasion. Besides
translating some of the works of Aristotle he wrote treatises on
logic, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy, and made an able
defence of the Nicene Creed against Arian attacks. The last
and most famous of his works, that for ten centuries men have
remembered and loved, was his <cite>Consolations of Philosophy</cite>,
written when death in a most horrible form was already drawing
close. Tortured by a cord drawn closely round his forehead,
and then beaten with clubs, the philosopher escaped from
a life where fortune had dealt with him cruelly. His master
survived him by two years, repenting on his death-bed in an
agony of remorse the brutal sentence he had meted out.</p>

<p>It is scarcely fair to judge Theodoric by the tyranny of his last
days. It is better to recall the glory of his prime, and how ‘in
the Western part of the Empire there was no people who refused
him homage’. Allied by family ties with the Burgundians, the
Visigoths, the Vandals, and the Franks, he was undoubtedly the
greatest of all the barbarians of his age. Had his successors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
shown a little of his statesmanlike qualities, Ostrogoth and
Italian, in spite of their religious differences, might have united
to form a single nation, but unfortunately, before twenty years had
passed, the kingdom he had founded was destined to disappear.</p>

<p>Theodoric was succeeded by his grandson, a boy who lived
only a few years, and then by a worthless nephew, without
either royal or statesmanlike qualities. In contrast to this weak
dynasty, there ruled at Constantinople an Emperor who possessed
in the highest degree the ability and steadfastness of purpose
that the times required.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Emperor Justinian</div>

<p>Justinian was only a peasant by birth, but he had been well
educated and took a keen interest not only in questions of law and
finance that concerned the government but in theology, music, and
architecture. In his manner to his subjects he was friendly
though dignified, but there was something unsympathetic in his
nature that prevented him from becoming popular. His courtiers
regarded his industry with awe, but some professed to believe
that he could not spend so many midnight hours at work unless
he were an evil spirit not requiring sleep. One writer says that
‘no one ever remembered him young’: yet this serious prince
married for love a beautiful actress, Theodora, and dared, in the
face of general indignation, to make her his empress. An
historian of the time says of Theodora, ‘it were impossible for
mere man to describe her comeliness in words or imitate it in
art’; yet she was no doll, but took a very definite share in the
government, extorting admiration by her dignity even from
those who had pretended to despise her.</p>

<p>Justinian’s chief passion was for building, and he spent a great
part of his revenue in erecting bridges, baths, forts, and palaces.
Most famous of all the architecture of his time was Saint Sophia,
‘the Church of the Holy Wisdom’, that after Constantinople
passed into the hands of the Turks became a mosque.</p>

<p>It is not, however, for Saint Sophia that Justinian is chiefly
remembered but for the <cite>Corpus Juris Civilis</cite>, literally ‘the body
of Civil Law’, that he published in order that his subjects
might know what the Roman law really was. The <cite>Corpus Juris
Civilis</cite> consisted of three parts&mdash;the ‘Code’, a collection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
of decrees made by various emperors; next the ‘Digest’, the
decisions of eminent lawyers; and thirdly the ‘Institutes’, an
explanation of the principles of Roman law. ‘After thirteen
centuries,’ says a modern writer, ‘it stands unsurpassed as
a treasury of legal knowledge;’ and all through the Middle Ages
men were to look to it for inspiration. Thus it was on the
<cite>Corpus Juris Civilis</cite> that ecclesiastical lawyers based the Canon
law that gave to the Pope an emperor’s power over the Church.</p>

<p>Justinian worked for the progress of the world when he
codified Roman law. It was unfortunate that military ambition
led him to exhaust his treasury and overtax his subjects, in order
that he might establish his rule over the whole of Europe like
Theodosius and Constantine. Besides carrying on an almost
continuous war with the King of Persia, he sent an army and fleet
under an able general, Belisarius, to fight against the Vandals
in North Africa; and so successful was this campaign that
Justinian became master of the whole coast-line, and even of a
part of southern Spain. This gave him command of the
Mediterranean, and he at once determined to overthrow the
feeble descendants of Theodoric, and to restore the imperial
dominion over Italy in deed, not as it had been from the time of
Odoacer merely in name.</p>

<p>The task was not easy, for the Italians, as we have noticed,
did not love the Greeks, while the Goths fought bravely for
independence. At length, in the year 555, after nineteen
campaigns, Narses, an Armenian who was at the head of
Justinian’s forces, succeeded in crushing the Barbarians and
established his rule at Ravenna, from which city, under the
title of <i>Exarch</i>, he controlled the whole peninsula.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lombard Invasion</div>

<p>Narses’ triumph had been in a great measure due to a German
tribe, ‘The Lombards’, whose hosts he had enrolled under the imperial
banner. These Lombards, <i>Longobardi</i> or ‘Long Beards’
as the name originally stood, had migrated from the banks of the
Elbe to the basin of the Danube, and there, looking about them for
a warlike outlet for their energies, were quite as willing to invade
Italy at Justinian’s command as to go on any other campaign
that promised to be profitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Narses, as soon as he was assured of success, paid them
liberally for their services and sent them back to their own people;
but the Lombards had learned to love the sunny climate and the
vines growing out of doors, and were soon discontented with
their bleaker homeland. They waited therefore until Narses,
whom they knew and feared, was dead; and then, under the
leadership of Alboin, their king, crossed over the Alps and
invaded North Italy. They did not come in such tremendous
strength as the Ostrogoths in the past, nor were the imperial
troops powerless to stand against them: indeed, the two forces
were so balanced that, while the Lombards succeeded in establishing
themselves in the province of Lombardy, to which they
gave their name, with Pavia as its capital, the representatives of
the Emperor still held the coast-line on both sides, also Ravenna,
Naples, Rome, and other principal towns.</p>

<p>This Lombard inroad, the last of the great Barbarian invasions
of Italy, was by far the most important in its effects. For one
thing, two hundred years were to pass before the power of the
new settlers was seriously shaken; and therefore, even the fact
that they were pagans and imposed their own laws ruthlessly on
the Italians could not keep the races from gradually intermingling.
In time the higher civilization conquered, and the
fair-haired Teutons learned to worship the Christian God, forgot
their own tongue, and adopted the customs and habits they saw
around them. The Italians, on their part, in the course of their
struggles with the Lombards became trained in the art of war
they had almost forgotten. By the eighth century the fusion was
complete.</p>

<p>Another very interesting and important result of the Lombard
invasion was that the prolonged duel between Barbarians and
Greeks prevented the development of any common form of
government. There might in time emerge an Italian race, but
there could be no Italian nation so long as towns and provinces
were dominated by rulers whose policy and ambitions were
utterly opposed. The <i>Exarch</i> of Ravenna claimed, in the name
of the Emperor at Constantinople, to collect taxes from and
administer the whole peninsula, but in practice he often ruled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
merely the strip of land round his city cut off from other Greek
officials by Lombard dukes. He would be able to communicate
by sea with the important towns on or near the coast, such as
Naples, but so irregularly that their governments would tend
to grow every year more independent of his control. In Rome,
for instance, there was not only the Senate with its traditions of
government, but the Pope, who even more than the Senate had
become the protector and adviser of his fellow citizens.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pope Gregory ‘the Great’</div>

<p>We have seen how Leo ‘the Great’ persuaded Attila the Hun
to withdraw when his armies threatened the very gates of Rome,
while later he went on a like though unavailing mission to
Genseric the Vandal. It was acts like these that won recognition
for the Papacy amongst other rulers; and more than any of the
Popes before him, Gregory ‘the Great’, who ascended the chair
of Peter in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 590, built up the foundations of this authority.</p>

<p>A Roman of position and wealth, Gregory had become in
middle age a poor monk, giving all his money to the poor and
disciplining himself by fasting and penance. He is remembered
best in England to-day for the interest he showed in the fair-haired
Angles in the Roman slave-market. ‘They have Angels’
faces, they should be fellow-heirs of the Angels in Heaven.’
His comment he followed up by a petition that he might sail as
a missionary to the northern island from which these slaves
came; and, when instead he was sent on an embassy to
Constantinople, he did not forget England in the years that
passed, but after he became Pope, chose St. Augustine to go and
convert the heathen King of Kent. In this way southern England
was christianized and brought into touch with the life of Western
Europe.</p>

<p>‘A great Pope,’ it has been said, ‘is always a missionary Pope.’
Gregory had the true missionary’s enthusiasm, and his writings,
all of them theological, bear the stamp of St. Augustine of Hippo’s
ardent spirit enforced with a faith absolutely assured and
unbending. Besides being instrumental in converting England,
Gregory during his pontificate saw the Arian Church in Spain
reconciled to the Catholic, while he succeeded in winning the
Lombard king to Christianity and friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
It was little wonder that the people of Rome, who had been at
war with these invaders for long years, looked up to the peace-maker
not only as their spiritual father but also as a temporal
ruler. Had he not fed them when they were starving, declaring
that it was thus the Church should use her wealth? Had he
not raised soldiers to guard the walls and sent out envoys
to plead the city’s cause against her enemies? There was no
such practical help to be obtained from the Exarchs of Ravenna,
talk as they might about the glories of Constantinople. Thus
Romans argued, and Gregory, who knew the real weakness
of Constantinople, was able to disregard the imperial viceroys
when he chose, a policy of independence followed by his
successors.</p>

<p>Since the Lombard kingdom had split up into a number
of duchies each with its own capital, Italy, in the early Middle
Ages, tended to become a group of city states, each jealous of its
neighbours and ambitious only for local interests. This provincial
influence was so strong that it has lasted into modern times. An
Englishman or a Frenchman will claim his country before
thinking of the particular part from which he comes, but it is
more natural for an Italian to say first ‘I am Roman,’ or
‘Neapolitan,’ or ‘Florentine,’ as the case may be. It is only
by remembering this difference that Italian history can be read
aright.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE RISE OF THE FRANKS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The historian Tacitus, whose description of the German tribes
we have already quoted, had told the people of Gaul that, unless
these same Germans were kept at bay by the Roman armies on
the Rhine frontier, they would ‘exchange the solitude of their
woods and morasses for the wealth and fertility of Gaul’. ‘The
fall of Rome,’ he added, ‘would be fatal to the provinces, and
you would be buried in the ruins of that mighty fabric.’</p>

<p>This prophetic warning proved only too true when Vandal
and Visigoth, Burgundian, Hun, and Frank forced the passage
of the Rhine, and swept in irresistible masses across vineyards
and cornfields, setting fire to those towns and fortresses that
dared to offer resistance. The Vandal migration was but a
meteor flash on the road to Spain and North Africa; while on
the battle-field of Chalons the Huns were beaten back and carried
their campaign of bloodshed to Italy: but the other three tribes
succeeded in establishing formidable kingdoms in Gaul during
the fifth and sixth centuries.</p>

<p>At the head of the Visigoths rode Athaulf, brother-in-law of
Alaric, unanimously chosen king by the tribe on the death of
that mighty warrior.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Instead of continuing the campaign in
South Italy, Athaulf had made peace with the Emperor Honorius
and married his sister, thus gaining a semi-royal position in the
eyes of Roman citizens.</p>

<p>‘I once aspired,’ he said frankly, ‘to obliterate the name of
Rome and to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths,
but ... I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially
necessary to maintain and regulate a well-constituted state....
From that moment, I proposed to myself a different object of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the
gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merits of a
stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert,
but to restore and maintain the prosperity of the Roman
Empire.’</p>

<p>Fortified by such sentiments and the benediction of the
Emperor, who was glad to free Italy from his brother-in-law’s
presence, Athaulf succeeded, after a short struggle, in establishing
a Visigothic kingdom in southern Gaul, stretching from the
Mediterranean to the Bay of Biscay. This, under his successors,
was enlarged until it embraced the whole of the province of
Aquitania, with Toulouse as its capital, as well as both slopes of
the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>The Burgundians, another German tribe, had, in the meanwhile,
built up a middle kingdom along the banks of the Rhone.
Years of intercourse with the Romans had done much to civilize
both their manners and thoughts, and they were quite prepared
to respect the laws and customs that they found in Gaul so long
as they met with no serious opposition to their rule. The fact
that both Burgundians and Visigoths were Arians raised, however,
a fatal barrier between conquerors and conquered, and did
more than anything else to determine that ultimate dominion
over the whole of Gaul should be the prize of neither of these
races, but of a third Teutonic tribe, the Salian Franks, whom
good fortune placed beyond the influence of heresy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Franks</div>

<p>The Franks were a tall, fair-haired, loose-limbed people, who,
emerging from Germany, had settled for a time in the country
we now call Belgium. Like their ancestors, they worshipped
Woden and other heathen gods of the Teutons, while in their
Salic law we see much to recall the German customs described
by Tacitus five centuries before.</p>

<p>The king was no longer elected by his people, for his office
had become hereditary in the House of Meroveus, one of the
heroes of the race. No woman, even of the Merovingian line,
might succeed to the throne, nor prince whose hair had been
shorn, since with the Franks flowing locks were a sign of royalty.
Yet, in spite of the king’s new position, the old spirit of equality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
had not entirely disappeared. The assembly of freemen, still
held once a year, had degenerated into a military review: but
the warriors thus collected could demand that the coming
campaign should meet with their approval. When a battle was
over and victory obtained, the lion’s share of the booty did not
fall to the king, but the whole was divided by lot.</p>

<p>A great part of the Salic law was really a tariff of violent acts,
with the fine that those who had committed them must pay, so
much for shooting a poisoned arrow, even if it missed its mark;
so much for wounding another in the head, or for cutting off his
nose, or his great toe, or, worst of all, for damaging his second
finger, so that he could no longer draw the bowstring.</p>

<p>The underlying principle of this code was different from that
of the Roman law, which set up a certain standard of right,
inflicting penalties on those who fell short of it. Thus the
Roman citizen who murdered or maimed his neighbour would
be punished because he had dared to do what the state condemned
as a crime. The Frank, in a similar case, would be fined
by the judges of his tribe, and the money paid as compensation
to the person, or the relations of the person, whom he had
wronged: the idea being, not to appease the anger of the state,
but to remove the resentment of the injured party.</p>

<p>For this purpose each Frank had his <em>wergeld</em>, literally his
‘worth-gold’ or the sum of money at which, according to his
rank, his life was valued, beginning with the nobles of the king’s
palace and descending in a scale to the lowest freeman. When
the Franks left Belgium and advanced, conquering, into northern
Gaul, they also fixed <em>wergelds</em> for their Roman subjects; but
rated them at only half the value of their own race. The
<em>wergeld</em> of a Frankish freeman was two hundred gold pieces, of
a Roman only one hundred.</p>

<p>By the beginning of the sixth century, when the Franks were
well established in Gaul, the management of their important
tribal affairs had passed entirely into the hands of the nobles
surrounding the king. These bore such titles as <em>Major Domus</em>
or ‘Mayor of the Palace’, at first only a steward, but later the
chief minister of the crown; the ‘Seneschal’ or head of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
royal household; the ‘Marshal’ or Master of the Stables; the
‘Chamberlain’ or chief servant of the bedchamber.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Clovis, King of the Franks</div>

<p>The most famous of the Merovingian kings, as the descendants
of Merovius were called, was Clovis, who established the
Frankish capital at Paris. He and his tribe, though pagans,
were on friendly terms with the Roman inhabitants of northern
Gaul, and especially with some of the Catholic clergy. When
Clovis sacked the town of Soissons he tried to save the church
plate, and especially a vase of great beauty that he knew St.
Remi, Bishop of Reims, highly valued. ‘Let it be put amongst
my booty,’ he said to his soldiers, intending to give it to the
bishop later; but one of them answered him insolently, ‘Only
that is thine which falls to thy share by lot,’ and with his axe he
shivered the vase into a thousand pieces.</p>

<p>Clovis concealed his fury at the moment, but he did not forget,
and a year afterwards, when he was reviewing his troops, he
noticed the same man who had opposed his will. Stepping
forward, he tore the fellow’s weapons from his grasp and threw
them on the ground, saying, ‘No arms are worse cared for than
thine!’ The soldier stooped to pick them up, and Clovis, raising
his battle-axe high in the air, brought it down on the bent head
before him with the comment, ‘Thus didst thou to the vase at
Soissons!’</p>

<p>Clovis married a Christian princess, Clotilda, a niece of the
Burgundian king, and, at her request, he allowed their eldest
child to be baptized, but for a long time he refused to become a
Christian himself. One day, however, when in the midst of
a battle in which his warriors were so hard pressed that they had
almost taken to flight, he cried aloud&mdash;‘Jesus Christ, thou whom
Clotilda doth call the Son of the Living God ... I now devoutly
beseech thy aid, and I promise if thou dost give me victory over
these my enemies ... that I will believe in thee and be baptized
in thy name, for I have called on my own gods and they have
failed to help me.’</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the tide of battle turned, the Franks rallied,
and Clovis obtained a complete victory. Remembering his
promise, he went to Reims, and there he and three thousand of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
his warriors were received into the Catholic Church. ‘Bow thy
head low,’ said St. Remi who baptized the King, ‘henceforth
adore that which thou hast burned and burn that which thou
didst formerly adore.’</p>

<p>When he became a Catholic, Clovis had no idea that he had
altered the whole future of his race, for to him it seemed merely
that he had fulfilled the bargain he had made with the Christian
God. He did not change his ways, but pursued his ambitions
as before, now by treachery and now by force. It was
his determination to make himself supreme ruler over all the
Franks, and in the case of another branch, the Ripuarians, he
began by secretly persuading their heir to the kingly title, the
young prince Chloderic, to kill his father and seize the royal
coffers.</p>

<p>Chloderic, fired by the idea of becoming powerful, did so and
wrote exultingly to Clovis, ‘My father is dead and his wealth
is mine. Let some of thy men come hither, and that of his
treasure which pleaseth them I will send thee.’</p>

<p>Ambassadors from the Salians duly arrived, and Chloderic led
them secretly apart and showed them his money, running his
hand through the pieces of gold that lay on the surface of the
coffer. The men begged him to thrust his arm in deep that they
might judge how great his wealth really was, and as he bent to
do so, one of them struck him a mortal wound from behind.
Then they fled. Thus by treachery died both father and son;
but Clovis unblushingly denied to the Ripuarian Franks that he
had been in any way responsible.</p>

<p>‘Chloderic murdered his father, and he hath been assassinated
by I know not whom. I am no partner in such deeds, for it is
against the law to take the life of relations. Nevertheless,
since it has happened, I offer you this advice, that you should
put yourselves under my protection.’</p>

<p>The Ripuarian Franks were without a leader, and like all
barbarians they worshipped success; so, believing that Clovis
would surely lead them to victory, they raised him on their
shields and hailed him as king.</p>

<p>‘Each day God struck down the enemies of Clovis under his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
hand,’ says Bishop Gregory of Tours, describing these events,
‘and enlarged his kingdom, because he went with an upright
heart before the Lord and did the things that were pleasing in
His sight.’ It is startling to find a bishop pass such a verdict
on a career of treachery and murder, the more that Gregory of
Tours was no cringing court-flatterer but a priest with a high
sense of duty who dared, when he believed it right, to oppose
some of the later Frankish kings even at the risk of his life.
Yet it must be remembered that a sense of honour was not
understood by barbarians, except in a very crude form. They
believed it was clever to outwit their neighbours, while to murder
them was so ordinary as to excite little or no comment, save the
infliction of a <em>wergeld</em> if the crime could be brought home.
Centuries of the civilizing influence of Christianity were needed
before the men and women of these fierce tribes could accept the
Christian principles of truth, justice, and mercy in anything like
their real spirit.</p>

<p>The Romans in Gaul had almost given up expecting anything
but brutality from their invaders if they aroused their enmity,
and therefore welcomed even the smallest sign of grace. Thus
the protection that Clovis afforded to the Catholic Church, after
her years of persecution, blinded their eyes to many of his vices.</p>

<p>When Clovis had made himself master of the greater part of
northern Gaul, he determined to strike a blow at the Visigoths
in the south. ‘It pains me,’ he said to his followers, ‘to see
Arians in a part of Gaul. Let us march against these heretics
with God’s aid and gain their country for ourselves.’</p>

<p>Probably he was sincere in his dislike of heresy, but it was a
politic attitude to adopt, for it meant that wherever he and his
warriors marched they would find help against the Burgundians
and Visigoths amongst the orthodox Roman population. It
seemed to the latter that Clovis brought with him something of
the glory of the vanished Roman Empire, kept alive by the
Catholic Church and now revived through her in this her latest
champion.</p>

<p>In a fierce battle near Poitiers, Clovis defeated the Visigoths
and drove them out of Aquitaine, leaving them merely narrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
strips of territory along the Mediterranean seaboard and on
either slope of the Pyrenees. He also fought against the
Burgundians and, though he was not so successful, reduced
them temporarily to submission. When he died, at the age
of forty-five, he was master of three-quarters of Gaul, and had
stamped the name of his race for ever on the land he had invaded.</p>

<p>His work of conquest was continued by his successors and
reached its zenith in the time of King Dagobert, who lived at
the beginning of the seventh century. Dagobert has been called
‘the French Solomon’, because, like the Jewish king, he was
world-famed for his wisdom and riches. Not content with
maintaining his power over Gaul to the west of the Rhine, he
fought against the Saxon and Frisian tribes in Germany and
forced them to pay tribute. At last his Empire stretched from
the Atlantic to the mountains of Bohemia; the Duke of Brittany,
who had hitherto remained independent of the Franks, came to
offer his allegiance, while the Emperor of Constantinople sought
a Frankish alliance.</p>

<p>A chronicler of the day, speaking of Dagobert, says, ‘He was
a prince terrible in his wrath towards traitors and rebels. He
held the royal sceptre firmly in his grasp, and like a lion he
sprang upon those who would foment discord.’</p>

<p>Another account describes his journeys through his kingdom,
and how he administered justice with an even hand, not altogether
to the joy of tyrannical landowners. ‘His judgements
struck terror into the hearts of the bishops and of the great
men, but it overwhelmed the poor with joy.’</p>

<p>In the troublous years that were to come his reign stood out
in people’s minds as an age of prosperity, but already, before the
death of the king, this prosperity had begun to wane. Luxury
sapped the vigour of a once-powerful mind and body, and the
authority that ‘the French Solomon’ relaxed in his later years
through self-indulgence was never regained by his successors.</p>

<p>With the contemptuous title ‘The Sluggard Kings’ the last
rulers of the Merovingian line have passed down to posterity.
Few were endowed with any ability or even ambition to govern,
the majority died before they had reached manhood looking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
already like senile old men; and the power that should have
been theirs passed into the hands of the Mayors of the Palace
who administered their demesnes. On state occasions, indeed,
they were still shown to their subjects, as they jolted to the
place of assembly in a rough cart drawn by oxen; but the
ceremony over, they returned to their royal villas and insignificance.
‘Nothing was left to the king save the name of king,
the flowing locks, the long beard. He sat on his throne and
played at government, gave audiences to envoys, and dismissed
them with the answers with which he had been schooled.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Carolingians</div>

<p>It was a situation that could only last so long as the name
‘Meroveus’ retained its spell over the Franks; but the day
came when the spell was broken, and a race of stronger fibre,
the Carolingians, usurped the royal title. The heads of this
family had for generations held the office of ‘Mayor of the
Palace’ in the part of Gaul between the Meuse and the Lower
Rhine, then called Austrasia. It was their duty to administer
the royal demesnes in this large district, that is, to see that the
laws were obeyed, to superintend the cultivation of the soil,
and to collect a share of the various harvests as a revenue for
the king.</p>

<p>This was more important work than it may sound to modern
ears; for in the early Middle Ages the majority of people, unlike
men and women to-day, lived in the country. Ever since the
decay of the Roman Empire, when the making of roads was
neglected and the imperial grain-fleets disappeared from the
Mediterranean, the problem of carrying merchandise and food
from one part of Europe to another had grown steadily more
acute. As commerce and industry languished, towns ceased to
be centres of population and became merely strongholds where
the neighbourhood could find refuge when attacked by its
enemies. People preferred to spend their ordinary life in villages
in the midst of fields, where they could grow corn and
barley, or keep their own sheep and oxen, and if the crops failed
or their beasts were smitten by disease a whole province might
suffer starvation.</p>

<p>The Mayor of the Palace must guard the royal demesnes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
as far as possible, from the ravages of weather, wolves, or
lawless men, for the King of the Franks, as much as any of
his subjects, depended on the harvests and herds for his
prosperity rather than on commerce or manufactures. By
the end of the seventh century the Mayors of Austrasia had
ceased to interest themselves merely in local affairs and had
begun to extend their authority over the whole of France.
Nominally, they acted in the name of the Merovingian kings,
but once when the throne fell vacant they did not trouble to fill
it for two years. The Franks made no protest: it was to their
mayors, not to their kings, that they now turned whether in
search of good government or daring national exploits.</p>

<p>The Carolingian Charles ‘Martel’, Charles ‘the Hammer’,
was a warrior calculated to arouse their profound admiration.
‘He was a Herculean warrior,’ says an old chronicle, ‘an ever-victorious
prince ... who triumphed gloriously over other
princes, and kings, and peoples, and barbarous nations: in so
much that, from the Slavs to the Frisians and even to the
Spaniards and Saracens, there were none who rose up against
him that escaped from his hand, without prostrating themselves
in the dust before his empire.’</p>

<p>It was Charles Martel who saved France from falling under
the yoke of the Saracens, a race of Arabian warriors who, crossing
from Africa at the Strait of Gibraltar, subdued in one short
campaign three-quarters of Spain. Describing the first great
victory over the Gothic King Rodrigo at Guadalete, the Governor
of Africa wrote to his master the Caliph, ‘O Commander of
the Faithful, these are no common conquests; they are like the
meeting of the nations on the Day of Judgement.’</p>

<p>Puffed up with the glory they had gained, the Saracens, who
were followers of the Prophet Mahomet, believed that they had
only to advance for Christian armies to run away; and over the
Pyrenees they swept in large bands, seizing first one stronghold
on the Mediterranean coast and then another. Before
this invasion Charles Martel had been engaged in a quarrel
with the Duke of Aquitaine, but now they hastily made friends
and on the field of Poitiers joined their forces to stem the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Saracen tide. So terrible was the battle, we are told, that
over three hundred thousand Saracens fell before the Frankish
warriors ‘inflexible as a block of ice’. The number is almost
certainly an exaggeration, and so also is the claim that the victors,
by forcing the remnant of the Mahometan army to retreat towards
the Pyrenees in hasty flight, saved Europe for Christianity.
Even had the decision of the battle been reversed, the Moors
would have found the task of holding Spain in the years to
come quite sufficient to absorb all their energies. Indeed, their
attacks on Gaul were, from the first, more in the nature of gigantic
raids than of invasions with a view to settlement, though at the
time their ferocity made them seem of world-wide importance.</p>

<p>Thus it was only natural that the Mayor of the Palace, to
whom the victory was mainly due, became the hero of Christendom.
The Pope, who was at that time trying to defend Rome
from the King of the Lombards, sent to implore his aid; but
Charles knew that his forces had been weakened by their struggle
with the Saracens and dared not undertake so big a campaign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pepin, King of the Franks</div>

<p>Some years later his son, Pepin ‘the Short’ (751–68), who had
succeeded him, received the suggestion with a different answer.
Pepin, as his nickname shows, was short in stature, but he was
powerfully built and so strong that with a single blow of his axe
he once cut off the head of a lion. Energetic and shrewd, he
saw a way of turning the Pope’s need of support against the
Lombards to his own advantage. He therefore sent Frankish
ambassadors to Rome to inquire whether it was not shameful
for a land to be governed by kings who had no authority. The
Pope, who was anxious to please Pepin, replied discreetly, ‘He
who possesses the authority should doubtless possess the title also.’</p>

<p>This was exactly what the Mayor of the Palace had expected
and wished, and the rest of the story may be told in the words
of the old Frankish annals for the year 751: ‘In this year
Pepin was named king of the Franks with the sanction of the
Popes, and in the city of Soissons he was anointed with the
holy oil ... and was raised to the throne after the custom of the
Franks. But Childeric, who had the name of king, was shorn
of his locks and sent into a monastery.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
The last of the Merovingians had vanished into the oblivion
of a cloister, and Pepin the Carolingian was ruler of France.
With the Pope’s blessing he had achieved his ambition, and
fortune soon enabled him to repay his debt, mainly, as it
happened, at another’s expense.</p>

<p>In the last chapter we described the effect of the Lombard
invasion of Italy, and how that Teutonic race sank its roots deep
in the heart of the peninsula, leaving a Greek fringe along the
coasts that still considered itself part of the Eastern Empire.
Rome in theory belonged to this fringe, but in reality the Popes
hated the imperial authority almost as much as the aggressions
of Lombard king and dukes, and struggled to free themselves
from its yoke.</p>

<p>When Pepin, his own ambition satisfied, turned his attention
to the Pope’s affairs, the Lombards had just succeeded in over-running
the Exarchate of Ravenna, the seat of the imperial
government in Italy. Collecting an army, the King of the
Franks crossed the Alps without encountering any opposition,
marched on Pavia, the Lombard capital, and struck such terror
into his enemies that, almost without fighting, they agreed to the
terms that he dictated.</p>

<p>Legally, he should have at once commanded the restoration
of the Exarchate to the Empire, but there was no particular
reason why Pepin should gratify Constantinople, while he had
a very strong inclination to please Rome. He therefore told
the Lombards to give the Exarchate to Stephen II, who was
Pope at that time, and this they faithfully promised to do; but,
as he turned homewards, they began instead to oppress the
country round Rome, preventing food from entering the city
and pillaging churches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Temporal Power of the Papacy</div>

<p>Pepin was very angry when he heard the news. Once more
he descended on Italy, and this time the Lombards were compelled
to keep their word, and the Papacy received the first of
its temporal possessions, ratified by a formal treaty that declared
the exact extent of the territory and the Papal rights over it.
This was an important event in mediaeval history, for it meant
that henceforward the Pope, who claimed to be the spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
head of Christendom, would be also an Italian prince with
recognized lands and revenues, and therefore with private
ambitions concerning these. It would be his instinct to distrust
any other ruler in the peninsula who might become powerful
enough to deprive him of these lands; while he would always
be faced, when in difficulties, by the temptation to use his
spiritual power to further purely worldly ends. On the way in
which Popes dealt with this problem of their temporal and
spiritual power, much of the future history of Europe was to
depend.</p>

<p>Pepin, in spite of his shrewdness, had no idea of the troubles
he had sown by his donation. Well pleased with the generosity
he had found so easy, with the title of ‘Patrician’ bestowed on
him by the Pope, and perhaps still more by the spoils that he
and his Franks had collected in Lombardy, he left Italy, and
was soon engaged in other campaigns nearer home against the
Saracens and rebellious German tribes. In these he continued
until his death in 768.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="VII"></a>VII<br />

<span class="subhead">MAHOMET</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Christianity, first preached by humble fishermen in Palestine,
had become the foundation of life in mediaeval Europe. Some
three hundred years after Constantine the Great had made this
possible another religion, ‘Islam’, destined to be the rival of
Christianity, was also born in the East, in Arabia, a narrow strip
of territory lying between the Red Sea and miles of uninhabitable
desert.</p>

<p>On the sea-coast of Arabia were some harbours, inland a few
fertile oases, where towns of low, white stone houses and mud
hovels had sprung into being; but from the very nature of the
soil and climate the Arabs were not drawn to manufacture goods
or grow corn. Instead they preferred a wanderer’s life, to tend
the herds of horses or sheep that ranged the peninsula in search
of water and pasturage, or if more adventurous to guard the
caravans of camels that carried the silks and spices of India to
Mediterranean seaports. These caravans had their regular
routes, and every merchant a band of armed men to protect his
goods and drive off robbers along the way. Only in the ‘Sacred
Months’, the time of the sowing of seeds in the spring and at
the autumn harvest, were such convoys of goods safe from attack;
for then, and then only, every Arab believed, according to the
traditions of his forefathers, that peace was a duty, and that
a curse would fall on him who dared to break it.</p>

<p>The Arab, like all Orientals, was superstitious. He worshipped
‘Allah’, the all supreme God, but he accepted also
a variety of other gods, heavenly bodies, spirits and devils,
stones and idols. One of the most famous Arabian sanctuaries
was a temple at Mecca called the ‘Ka’bah’, where a black stone
had been built into the wall that pilgrims would come from long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
distances to kiss and worship. Amongst the youths of the town
who saw this ceremony and himself took part in the religious
processions was an orphan lad, Mahomet (576–632), brought
up in the house of his uncle, Abu Talib.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Young Mahomet</div>

<p>Mahomet was handsome and strong: he had looked after
sheep on the edge of the desert, taken part in tribal fights, and
from the age of twelve wandered with caravans as far as the
sea-coast. What distinguished him from his companions was
not his education, nor any special skill as a warrior, but his
quickness of observation, his tenacious memory, and his gift for
bending others to his will. Unable to read, he could only gain
knowledge by word of mouth, and wherever he went, amongst
the colonies of the Jews who were the chief manufacturers in the
towns, or lying beside the camp fires of the caravans at night,
he would keep his ears open and store up in his mind all the
tales that he heard. In this way he learned of the Jewish
religion and a garbled version of Christianity. Soon he knew
the stories of Joseph and of Abraham and some of the sayings
of Christ, and the more he thought over them the more he grew
to hate the idol worship of the Arabs round him.</p>

<p>When he was twenty-five Mahomet married a rich widow,
Khadijah, whose caravan he had successfully steered across the
desert; and in this way he became a man of independent means,
possessing camels and horses of his own. Khadijah was some
years older than Mahomet, but she was a very good wife to him,
and brought him not only a fortune but a trust and belief in his
mission that he was to need sorely in the coming years. To her
he confided his hatred of idol-worship, and also to Abu Bakr, the
wealthy son of a cloth merchant of Mecca, who had fallen under
his influence. Mahomet declared that God, and later the Angel
Gabriel, had appeared to him in visions and had given him
messages condemning the superstitions of the Arabs.</p>

<p>‘There is but one God, Allah ... and Mahomet is His Prophet.’</p>

<p>This was the chief message, received at first with contempt
but destined to be carried triumphant in the centuries to come
right to the Pyrenees and the gates of Vienna.</p>

<p>The visions, or trances, during which Mahomet received his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
messages, afterwards collected in the sacred book, the Koran,
are thought by many to have been epileptic fits. His face
would turn livid and he would cover himself with a blanket,
emerging at last exhausted to deliver some command or
exhortation. Later it would seem that he could produce this
state of insensibility at will and without much effort, whenever
questions were asked, indeed, in answering which he required
divine guidance. Much of the teaching in the Koran was based,
like Judaism or Christianity, on far higher ideals than the fetish
worship of the Arabs: it emphasized such things as the duty of
almsgiving, the discipline that comes of fasting, the necessity of
personal cleanliness, while it forbade the use of wine, declaring
drunkenness a crime.</p>

<p>With regard to the position of women the Koran could show
nothing of the chivalry that was to develop in Christendom
through the respect felt by Christians for the mother of Christ
and for the many women martyrs and saints who suffered
during the early persecutions. Moslems were allowed by the
Koran to have four wives (Mahomet permitted himself ten), and
these might be divorced at their husband’s pleasure without any
corresponding right on their part. On the other hand the
power of holding property before denied was now secured to
women, and the murder of female children that had been
a practice in the peninsula was sternly abolished.</p>

<p>As the years passed more and more ‘Surahs’, or chapters, were
added to the Koran, but at first the Prophet’s messages were
few and appealed only to the poor and humble. When the
Meccans, told by Abu Bakr that Mahomet was a prophet, came
to demand a miracle as proof, he declared that there could be no
greater miracle than the words he uttered; but this to the
prosperous merchants seemed merely crazy nonsense. When
he went farther, and, acting on what he declared was Allah’s
revelation, destroyed some of the local idols, contempt changed
to anger; for the inhabitants argued that if ‘Ka’bah’ ceased to be
a sanctuary their trade with the pilgrims who usually came to
Mecca would cease.</p>

<p>For more than eight years, while the Prophet maintained his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
unpopular mission, his poorer followers were stoned and beaten,
and he himself shunned. Perhaps it seems odd that in such
a barbarous community he was not killed; but though Arabia
possessed no government in any modern sense, yet a system of
tribal law existed that went far towards preventing promiscuous
murder. Each man of any importance belonged to a tribe that
he was bound to support with his sword, and that in turn was
responsible for his life. If he were slain the tribe would exact
vengeance or demand ‘blood money’ from the murderer. Now
the head of Mahomet’s tribe was Abu Talib, his uncle, and,
though the old man refused to accept his nephew as a prophet,
he would not allow him to be molested.</p>

<p>In spite of persecution the number of believers in Mahomet’s
doctrines grew, and when some of those who had been driven
out of the city took refuge with the Christian King of Abyssinia
and were treated by him with greater kindness than the pagan
Arabs, the Meccans at home became so much alarmed that
they adopted a new policy of aggression. Henceforward both
Mahomet and his followers, the hated ‘Moslems’, or ‘heathen’
as they were nicknamed in the Syriac tongue, were to be outlaws,
and no one might trade with them or give them food.</p>

<p>In an undisciplined community like an Arabian town such an
order would not be strictly kept, and for three years Mahomet
was able to defy the ban, but every day his position grew more
precarious and the sufferings of his followers from hunger and
poverty increased. During this time too both Khadijah and
Abu Talib died, and the Prophet, almost overwhelmed with his
misfortunes, was only kept from doubting his mission by the faith
and loyalty of those who would not desert him.</p>

<p>Weary of trying to convert Mecca he sent messengers through
Arabia to find if there were any tribe that would welcome
a prophet, and at last he received an invitation to go to Yathrib.
This was a larger town than Mecca, farther to the north, and was
populated mainly by Jewish tribes who hated the Arabian idol-worshippers
and welcomed the idea of a teacher whose views
were based largely on Jewish traditions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hijrah</div>

<p>In 622, therefore, Mahomet and his followers fled secretly from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Mecca to Yathrib, later called Medinah or ‘the city of the
Prophet’; and this date of the ‘Hijrah’ or ‘Flight’, when the
new religion broke definitely with old Arab traditions, was taken
as the first year of the Moslem calendar, just as Christians
reckon their time from the birth of Christ. Here in Medinah
was built the first mosque, or temple of the new faith, a faith
christened by its believers Islam, a word meaning ‘surrender’,
for in surrender to Allah and to the will of his Prophet lay the
way of salvation to the Moslem Garden of Paradise.</p>

<p>So beautiful to the Arab mind were the very material luxuries
and pleasures with which Mahomet entranced the imagination of
believers that in later years his soldiers would fling themselves
recklessly against their enemies’ spears in order to gain
Paradise the quicker. The alternative for the unbeliever was
Hell, the everlasting fires of the Old Testament that so terrified
the minds of mediaeval Christians; and between Paradise and
Hell there was no middle way.</p>

<p>The Jews in Medinah were, like Mahomet, worshippers of
one God, but they soon showed that they were not prepared to
accept this wandering Arab as Jehovah’s final revelation to man.
They demanded miracles, sneered at the Koran, which they
declared was a parody of their own Scriptures, and took advantage
of the poverty of the refugees to drive hard bargains with
them. At length it became obvious that the Moslems must find
some means of livelihood or else Medinah, like Mecca, must be
left for more friendly soil.</p>

<p>Pressed by circumstances Mahomet evolved a policy that was
destined to overthrow the tribal system of government in Arabia.
Mention has been made already of the caravans of camels that
journeyed regularly from south to north of the peninsula, bearing
merchandise. Many of these caravans were owned by wealthy
Meccans, whose chief trade route passed quite close by the town
of Medinah, and they were protected and guarded by members
of the tribe of Abu Talib and of other families whose relations
were serving with the Prophet.</p>

<p>At first, when Mahomet commanded that these caravans should
be attacked and looted, his followers looked aghast, for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
sacredness of tribes from attack by kinsmen was a tradition they
had inherited for generations. Their Prophet at once proved
to them by a message from Allah that a new relationship had
been formed stronger than the ties of blood, namely, the bond of
faith, and that to the believer the unbeliever, whether father or
son, was accursed. In the same way, when the first marauding
expeditions were unsuccessful because the caravans attacked
were too well guarded, Mahomet explained away the ‘Sacred
Months’ and chose in future that very time for his warriors to
descend upon unsuspecting merchants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Badr</div>

<p>The Meccans, outraged by what they somewhat naturally considered
treachery, soon dispatched some thousand men, determined
to make an end of the Prophet and his followers; and
at Badr, not very far from the coast on the trade route between
the two towns, this large force encountered three hundred
Moslems commanded by Mahomet. It is difficult to gain a clear
impression of the battle, for romance and legend have rendered
real details obscure; but, either by superior generalship, the
valour and discipline of the Moslems as compared to the conduct
of their forces, or, as was later stated, through the agency of
angels sent by Allah from Heaven, the vastly more numerous
Meccan force was utterly put to rout.</p>

<p>Moslems refer to the battle of Badr as ‘the Day of Deliverance’,
for though, not long afterwards, they in their turn were defeated
by the Meccans, yet never again were they to become mere discredited
refugees. Success pays, and, with the victory of Badr
as a tangible miracle to satisfy would-be converts, Mahomet
soon gained a large army of warriors, whom his personality
moulded into obedience to his will.</p>

<p>The Jews who had mocked him had soon cause to repent, for
Mahomet, remembering their jibes and the petty persecution to
which they had subjected his followers, adopted a definitely
hostile attitude towards them. Taking advantage of the reluctance
with which these Jews had shared in the defence of Medinah
and in the throwing-up of earthworks to protect it, when the
Meccans came to besiege it in the year 5 of the new calendar,
Mahomet as soon as the siege was raised obtained his revenge.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Those Jews of the city who still refused to recognize him as
a Prophet were slaughtered, their wives and children sold into
slavery. The teaching and ritual of the Koran also, once carefully
based on the Scriptures of Israel, began to cast off this
influence, and where of old Mahomet had commanded his
followers to look towards Jerusalem in their prayers, he now
bade them kneel with their faces towards Mecca.</p>

<p>In this command may be seen his new policy of conciliation
towards his native town; for Mahomet recognized that in the
city of Mecca lay the key to the peninsula, and he was determined
to establish his power there, if not by force then by
diplomacy. After some years of negotiation he persuaded those
who had driven him into exile not so much of the truth of his
teaching as of the certainty that his presence would bring more
pilgrims than ever before to visit the shrine of Ka’bah.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 630 he entered Mecca in triumph, and the worship of
Islam was established in the heart of Arabia. As a concession
to the Meccans, divine revelation announced that the sacred
black stone built into the temple wall had been hallowed by
Abraham, and was therefore worthy of veneration.</p>

<p>Instead of a general scheme of revenge only two of Mahomet’s
enemies were put to death; and it is well to remember that,
judged by the standards of his age and race, the Prophet was no
lover of cruelty. In his teaching he condemned the use of
torture, and throughout his life he was nearly always ready to
treat with his foes rather than slay them. Those amongst his
enemies who refused him recognition as a Prophet while willing
to acknowledge him as a ruler were usually allowed to live in
peace on the payment of a yearly ransom divided amongst the
believers; but in cases where he had met with an obstinate
refusal or persistent treachery, as from the Jews of Medinah,
Mahomet would put whole tribes to the sword.</p>

<p>In 632 the Prophet of Islam died, leaving a group of Arabian
tribes bound far more securely together by the faith he had
taught them than they could have been by the succession of any
royal house. ‘Though Mahomet is dead, yet is Mahomet’s
God not dead.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
While Mahomet was still an exile at Medinah it is evident
that he already contemplated the idea of gaining the world for
Islam. ‘Let there be in you a nation summoning unto good,’
says the Koran, and in token of this mission the Prophet, in the
years following his Arabian victories, sent letters to foreign
rulers to announce his ambition. Here is one to the chief of the
Copts, a Christian race living in Egypt:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘In the name of Allah ... the Merciful.</p>

<p>‘From the Apostle of Allah to ..., Chief of the Copts.
Peace be upon him who follows the guidance. Next I summon
thee with the appeal to Islam: become a Moslem and thou shalt
be safe. God shall give thee thy reward twofold. But if thou
decline then on thee is the guilt of the Copts. O ye people of
the Book come unto an equal arrangement between us and you
that we should serve none save God, associating nothing with
Him, and not taking one another for Lords besides God,&mdash;and
if ye decline, then bear witness that we are Moslems.’</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">The Kingdom of Persia</div>

<p>Similar letters were sent to Chosroes, King of Persia, and to
Heraclius, the Christian Emperor at Constantinople. The
former tore the letter in pieces contemptuously, for at that time
his kingdom extended over the greater part of Asia; Jerusalem,
once the pride of the Eastern Empire, had fallen into his grasp;
while his armies were besieging Constantinople itself. A letter
that he himself penned to the Christian Emperor shows his overweening
pride, and the depths into which Byzantium had fallen
in the public regard:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Chosroes, Greatest of Gods, and Master of the whole earth,
to Heraclius, his vile and insensate slave. Why do you still
refuse to submit to our rule and call yourself a king? Have I
not destroyed the Greeks? You say that you trust in your God.
Why has he not delivered out of my hand Caesarea, Jerusalem,
Alexandria? and shall I not also destroy Constantinople? But
I will pardon your faults if you will submit to me, and come
hither with your wife and children, and I will give you lands,
vineyards, and olive groves, and look upon you with a kindly
aspect. Do not deceive yourself with vain hope in that Christ,
who was not even able to save himself from the Jews, who killed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
him by nailing him to a cross. Even if you take refuge in the
depths of the sea I shall stretch out my hand and take you, so
that you shall see me whether you will or no.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Christendom was fortunate in Heraclius. Instead of contemplating
either despair or surrender, he called upon the Church
to summon all Christians to his aid, and by means of the gold
and silver plate presented to him as a war loan by the bishops
and clergy, and in command of a large army of volunteers, he
beat back the Persians from the very gates of his capital. Not
content with a policy of defence, he next invaded Asia, and at
the battle of Nineveh utterly destroyed the hosts of Chosroes.
The fallen King, deposed by his subjects, was forced to take
refuge in the mountains, and later was thrown into a dungeon
where he died of cold and starvation.</p>

<p>Had the reign of Heraclius ended at this date, it would be remembered
as a glorious era in the history of Constantinople;
but unfortunately for his fame another foe was to make more
lasting inroads on his Empire, already weakened by the Persian
occupation.</p>

<p>When the Emperor (610–41), like Chosroes, received
Mahomet’s letter, he is said to have read it with polite interest.
It seemed to him that this fanatic Arab, who hated the Jews as
much as the Christians did, might turn his successful sword not
only against them but against the Persians. In this surmise
Heraclius was right, for under Abu Bakr, now Caliph, or
‘successor’, of Mahomet, since the Prophet had left no son,
the Moslems invaded Persia.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Heraclius, they were equally bent on an
aggressive campaign against the Christian Empire. ‘There is
but one God, Allah!’ With this test, by which they could
distinguish friend from foe, the Arab hosts burst through the
gate of Syria, and at Yermuk encountered the imperial army
sent by Heraclius to oppose them. The Greeks fought so
stubbornly that at first it seemed that their disciplined valour
must win. ‘Is not Paradise before you?... Are not Hell and
Satan behind?’ cried the Arab leader to his fanatical hordes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
and in response to his words they rallied, broke the opposing
lines by the sudden ferocity of their charge, and finally drove
the imperial troops in headlong flight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mahometan Victories</div>

<p>After the battle of Yermuk Syria fell and Palestine was
invaded. In 637 Jerusalem became a Moslem town, with a
mosque standing where once had been the famous temple of
Solomon. Mahomet had declared Jerusalem a sanctuary only
second in glory to Mecca; and his followers with a toleration
strange in that age left under Christian guardianship the Tomb
of the Holy Sepulchre and other sacred sites.</p>

<p>After Syria, Palestine; after Palestine, Egypt and the north
African coast-line. The dying Heraclius heard nothing but the
bitter news of disaster, and after his death the quarrels of his
descendants increased the feebleness of Christian resistance.
A spirit of unity might have carried the Moslem banners to the
limits of the Eastern Empire, but in 656 the Caliph Othman was
murdered, and the civil war that ensued enabled the Christian
Emperor, Constans II, to negotiate peace. He had lost Tripoli,
Syria, Egypt, and the greater part of Armenia to his foes, who
had also succeeded in establishing a naval base in the Mediterranean
that threatened the islands of Greece herself. In the
north his borders were overrun by Bulgar and Slav tribes,
while in Italy the Lombards maintained a perpetual struggle
against his viceroy, the Exarch of Ravenna.</p>

<p>Constans himself spent six years in Italy, the greater part in
campaigns against the Lombards. He even visited Rome, but
earned hatred there as elsewhere by his ruthless pillage of the
West for the benefit of the East. Thus the Pantheon was
stripped of its golden tiles to enrich Constantinople, and the
churches of South Italy robbed of their plate to pay for his wars.
At last a conspiracy was formed against him, and while enjoying
the baths at Syracuse one of his servants struck him on the
head with a marble soap-box and fractured his skull. Constans
had been a brave and resolute Emperor of considerable military
ability. His son, Constantine ‘Pogonatus’, or ‘the bearded’,
inherited his gifts and drove back the Mahometans from
Constantinople with so great a loss of men and prestige that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Caliph promised to pay a large sum of money as tribute every
year in return for peace.</p>

<p>Constantine ‘Pogonatus’ died when a comparatively young
man and was succeeded by his son, Justinian II, a lad of seventeen,
arrogant, cruel, and restless. Without any reason save
ambition he picked a quarrel with the Moslem Caliph, marched
a large army across his Eastern border, and, when he met with
defeat, proceeded in his rage to execute his generals and soldiers,
declaring that they had failed him. At home, in Constantinople,
his ministers tortured the inhabitants in order to exact money
for his treasury and filled the imperial dungeons with senators
and men of rank suspected of disloyalty.</p>

<p>Such a state of affairs could not last; and the Emperor, who
treated his friends as badly as his foes, was captured by one
of his own generals, and, after having his nose cruelly slit, was
exiled to the Crimea. Mutilation was supposed to be a final
bar to the right of wearing the imperial crown; but Justinian II
was the type of man to be ignored only when dead. After some
years of brooding over his wrongs he fled from the Crimea and
took refuge with the King of the Bulgars.</p>

<p>On his sea-journey a terrific storm arose that threatened to
overwhelm both him and his crew. ‘My Lord,’ exclaimed one
of his attendants, ‘I pray you make a vow to God that if He
spare you, you also will spare your enemies.’ ‘May God sink
this vessel here and now,’ retorted his master, ‘if I spare a
single one of them that falls into my hands,’ and the words were
an ill omen for his reign, that began once more in 705 when,
with the aid of Bulgar troops and of treachery within the
capital, Justinian II established himself once more in Constantinople.</p>

<p>During six years the Empire suffered his tyranny anew; and
those who had previously helped to dethrone him were hunted
down, tortured, and put to death. Like Nero of old he burned
alive his political enemies, or he would order the nobles of his
court who had offended him to be sewn up in sacks and thrown
into the sea. At last another rebellion brought a final end to
his reign, and that of the house of Heraclius, for both he and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
young son were murdered, and the Eastern Empire given up
to anarchy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Leo the Isaurian</div>

<p>The man who did most to save Constantinople from the next
Mahometan invasion was one of the military governors of the
Empire called Leo the Isaurian. Conscious of his own ability
he took advantage of his first successes to seize the imperial
crown; and then, having heard that the Mahometan fleet was
moored off the shores of Asia Minor, he secretly sent a squadron
of his own vessels that set the enemy’s ships on fire. In the
panic that ensued more than half the Arabian ships were sunk.
About the same time a Mahometan land force was also defeated
by the King of the Bulgars, who had allied himself with the
Emperor on account of their mutual dread of an Eastern invasion.
The result of these combined Christian victories was that the
Caliph Moslemah, whose main forces were encamped beneath
the walls of Constantinople, grew alarmed lest he should be cut
off from support and provisions. He therefore raised the siege,
embarked his army in what remained of his fleet, and retreated
to his own kingdom, leaving the Christian capital free from acute
danger from the East for another three hundred years.</p>

<p>Elsewhere the Mahometans pursued their triumphant progress
with little check. After the fall of Carthage in 697 North Africa
lay almost undefended before them; and the half-savage tribes
such as the Berbers, who lived on the borders of the desert,
welcomed the new faith with its mission of conversion by the
sword and prospects of plunder.</p>

<p>It was the Berbers who at the invitation, according to tradition,
of a treacherous Spanish Governor, Count Julian, crossed the
Strait of Gibraltar and descended on the plains of Andalusia.</p>

<p>Spain, when the power of the Roman Empire snapped, had
been invaded first by Vandals and then by Visigoths. The
Vandals, as we have seen,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> passed on to Africa, while the
Visigoths, like the Lombards in Italy, became converted to
Christianity, and, falling under the influence of the civilization
and luxury they saw around them, gradually adapted their
government, laws, and way of life to the system and ideals of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
those whom they had conquered. Thus their famous <em>Lex
Visigothorum</em>, or ‘Law of the Visigoths’, was in reality the
Roman code remodelled to suit the German settlers.</p>

<p>In this new land the descendants of the once warlike Teutons
acquired an indifference to the arts of war, and when their King
Rodrigo had been killed at the disastrous battle of Guadelete
and his army overthrown, they made little further resistance to
the Saracen hordes except in the far northern mountains of the
Asturias. From France we have seen<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> the Mahometans were
beaten back by Charles Martel, and here, established in Spain
and on the borders of the Eastern Empire, we must leave their
fortunes for the time. If Mahomet’s life is short and can be
quickly told the story of how his followers attempted to establish
their rule over Christendom is nothing else than the history
of the foreign policy of Europe during mediaeval times.</p>

<span class="subhead">CHARLEMAGNE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Just before his death Pepin the Short had divided his lands
between his two sons, Charles, who was about twenty-six, and
Carloman, a youth some years younger. As they had no affection
for each other, this division did not work well. Carloman
gave little promise of statesmanlike qualities: he was peevish
and jealous, and easily persuaded by the nobles who surrounded
him that his elder brother was a rival who intended to rob him
of his possessions, it might be of his life. There seems to have
been no ground for this suspicion; but nevertheless he spent his
days in trying to hinder whatever schemes Charles proposed;
and when he died, three years later, there was a general breath
of relief.</p>

<p>Enumerating the blessings that Heaven had bestowed on
Charlemagne, a monk, writing to the King about this time, completed
his list with the candid statement: ‘the fifth and not
least that God has removed your brother from this earthly
kingdom’.</p>

<p>Charlemagne was exactly the kind of person to seize the
fancy of the early Middle Ages. Tall and well built, with an
eagle nose and eyes that flashed like a lion when he was angry
so that none dared to meet their gaze, he excelled all his court
in strength, energy, and skill. He could straighten out with
his fingers four horseshoes locked together, lift a warrior fully
equipped for battle to the level of his shoulder, and fell a horse
and its rider with a single blow.</p>

<p>It was his delight to keep up old national customs and to wear
the Frankish dress with its linen tunic, cross-gartered leggings,
and long mantle reaching to the feet. ‘What is the use of these
rags?’ he once inquired contemptuously of his courtiers, pointing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
to their short cloaks&mdash;‘Will they cover me in bed, or shield
me from the wind and rain when I ride abroad?’</p>

  <img src="images/i_088.jpg" width="600" height="533" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">The EMPIRE of<br />CHARLEMAGNE</div></div>

<p>This criticism was characteristic of the King. Intent on
a multitude of schemes for the extension or improvement of his
lands, and so eager to realize them that he would start on fresh
ones when still heavily encumbered with the old, he was yet,
for all his enthusiasm, no vague dreamer but a level-headed man
looking questions in the face and demanding a practical answer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Chanson de Roland</div>

<p>By the irony of fate it is the least practical and important task
he undertook that has made his name world-famous; for the
story of Charlemagne and his Paladins, told in that greatest
of mediaeval epics, the <cite>Chanson de Roland</cite>, exceeds to-day in
popularity even the exploits of Arthur and the Knights of the
Round Table.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
This much is history&mdash;that Charlemagne, invited secretly by
some discontented Emirs to invade Spain and attack the Caliph
of Cordova, crossed the Pyrenees, and, after reducing several
towns successfully, was forced to retreat. On his way back
across the mountains his rearguard was cut off by Gascon
mountaineers, and slaughtered almost to a man; while he and
the rest of his army escaped with difficulty.</p>

<p>On this meagre and rather inglorious foundation poets of the
eleventh century based a cycle of romance. Charlemagne is
the central figure, but round him are grouped numerous
‘Paladins’, or famous knights, including the inseparable friends
Oliver and Roland, Warden of the Breton Marches. After
numerous deeds of glory in the land of Spain, the King, it was
said, was forced by treachery to turn back towards the French
mountains, and had already passed the summits, when Roland,
in charge of the rearguard, found himself entrapped in the Pass
of Roncesvalles by a large force of Gascons. His horn was
slung at his side but he disdained to summon help from those
in the van, and drawing his good sword ‘Durenda’ laid about
him valiantly.</p>

<p>The Gascons fell back, dismayed by the vigorous resistance
of the French; but thirty thousand Saracens came to their aid,
and the odds were now overwhelming. Oliver lay dead, and,
covered with wounds, Roland fell to the ground also, but first
of all he broke ‘Durenda’ in half that none save he might use
this peerless blade. Putting his horn to his lips, with his dying
breath he sounded a blast that was heard by Charlemagne in
his camp more than eight miles away. ‘Surely that is the horn
of Roland?’ cried the King uneasily, but treacherous courtiers
explained away the sound; and it was not till a breathless
messenger came with the news of the reverse that he hastened
towards the scene of battle. There in the pass, stretched on
the ground amid the heaped-up bodies of their enemies, he found
his Paladins&mdash;Roland with his arms spread in the form of
a cross, his broken sword beside him: and seeing him the King
fell on his knees weeping. ‘Oh, right arm of thy Sovereign’s
body, Honour of the Franks, Sword of Justice.... Why did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
I leave thee here to perish? How can I behold thee dead and
not die with thee?’ At last, restraining his grief, Charlemagne
gathered his forces together; and the very sun, we are told,
stood still to watch his terrible vengeance on Gascons and
Saracens for the slaughter of Christians at Roncesvalles.</p>

<p>The <cite>Chanson de Roland</cite> is one of the masterpieces of French
literature. It is not history, but in its fiction lies a substantial
germ of truth. Charlemagne in the early ninth century was
what poets described him more than two hundred years later&mdash;the
central figure in Christendom, the recognized champion of
the Cross whether against Mahometans or pagans. ‘Through
your prosperity’, wrote Alcuin, an Anglo-Saxon monk and
scholar who lived at his court, ‘Christendom is preserved, the
Catholic Faith defended, the law of justice made known to all
men.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Invasion of Lombardy</div>

<p>When the Popes sought help against the Lombards, it was to
Charlemagne as to his father Pepin that they naturally turned.
Charlemagne had hoped at the beginning of his reign to maintain
a friendship with King Didier of Lombardy and had even
married his daughter, an alliance that roused the Pope of that
date to demand in somewhat violent language: ‘Do you not
know that all the children of the Lombards are lepers, that the
race is outcast from the family of nations? For these there is
neither part nor lot in the Heavenly Kingdom. May they broil
with the devil and his angels in everlasting fire!’</p>

<p>Charlemagne went his own way, in spite of papal denunciations;
but he soon tired of his bride, who was plain and feeble
in health, and divorced her that he might marry a beautiful
German princess. This was, of course, a direct insult to King
Didier, who henceforth regarded the Frankish king as his enemy;
and Rome took care that the gulf once made between the
sovereigns should not be bridged.</p>

<p>In papal eyes the Lombards had really become accursed. It
is true that they had been since the days of Gregory the Great
orthodox Catholics, that their churches were some of the most
beautiful in Italy, their monasteries the most famous for learning,
and Pavia, their capital, a centre for students and men of letters.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Their sin did not lie in heretical views, but in the position of
their kingdom that now included not only modern Lombardy
in the north, but also the Duchy of Spoletum in South Italy.
Between stretched the papal dominions like a broad wall from
Ravenna to the Western Mediterranean; and on either side
the Lombards chafed, trying to annex a piece of land here or
a city there, while the Popes watched them, lynx-eyed, eager on
their part to dispossess such dangerous neighbours, but unable
to do so without assistance from beyond the Alps.</p>

<p>Soon after the death of his younger brother Charlemagne
was persuaded to take up the papal cause and invade Italy.
At Geneva, where he held the ‘Mayfield’ or annual military
review of his troops, he laid the object of his campaign before
them, and was answered by their shouts of approval.</p>

<p>It was a formidable host, for the Franks expected every man
who owned land in their dominions to appear at these gatherings
prepared for war. The rich would be mounted, protected by
mail shirts and iron headpieces, and armed with sword and
dagger; the poor would come on foot, some with bows and
arrows, others with lance and shield, and the humblest of all
with merely scythes or wooden clubs. Tenants on the royal
demesnes must bring with them all the free men on their estates;
and while it was possible to obtain exemption the fine demanded
was so heavy that few could pay it.</p>

<p>When the army set out in battle array, it was accompanied
by numerous baggage-carts, lumbering wagons covered with
leather awnings, that contained enough food for three months
as well as extra clothes and weapons. It was the general hope
that on the return journey the wagons would be filled to overflowing
with the spoils of the conquered enemy.</p>

<p>The Lombards had ceased, with the growth of luxury and
comfortable town life, to be warriors like the Franks; and
Charlemagne met with almost as little resistance as Pepin in
past campaigns. After a vain attempt to hold the Western
passes of the Alps, Didier and his army fled to Pavia, where
they fortified themselves, leaving the rest of the country at the
mercy of the invaders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Frankish chroniclers in later years drew a realistic picture
of Didier, crouched in one of the high towers of the city, awaiting
in trembling suspense the coming of the ‘terrible Charles’.
Beside him stood Otger, a Frankish duke, who had been
a follower of the dead Carloman and was therefore hostile to
his elder brother. ‘Is Charles in that great host?’ demanded
the King continually, as first the long line of baggage-wagons
came winding across the plain, and then an army of the ‘common-folk’,
and after them the bishops with their train of abbots and
clerks. Every time his companion answered him, ‘No! not yet!’</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Then Didier hated the light of day. He stammered and
sobbed and said, “Let us go down and hide in the earth from so
terrible a foe.” And Otger too was afraid; well he knew the
might and the wrath of the peerless Charles; in his better days
he had often been at court. And he said, “When you see the
plain bristle with a harvest of spears, and rivers of black steel
come pouring in upon your city walls, then you may look for the
coming of Charles.” While he yet spoke a black cloud arose
in the West and the glorious daylight was turned to darkness.
The Emperor came on; a dawn of spears darker than night rose
on the beleaguered city. King Charles, that man of iron, appeared;
iron his helmet, iron his armguards, iron the corselet
on his breast and shoulders. His left hand grasped an iron
lance ... iron the spirit, iron the hue of his war steed. Before,
behind, and at his side rode men arrayed in the same guise.
Iron filled the plain and open spaces, iron points flashed back
the sunlight. “There is the man whom you would see,” said
Otger to the king; and so saying he swooned away, like one
dead.’</p></blockquote>

<p>In spite of this picture of Carolingian might, it took the
Franks six months to reduce Pavia; and then Didier, at last
surrendering, was sent to a monastery, while Charlemagne proclaimed
himself king of the newly acquired territories. During
the siege, leaving capable generals to conduct it, he himself had
gone to Rome, where he was received with feasting and joy.
Crowds of citizens came out to the gates to welcome him,
carrying palms and olive-branches, and hailed him as ‘Patrician’
and ‘Defender of the Church’. Dismounting from his horse
he passed on foot through the streets of Rome to the cathedral;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
and there, in the manner of the ordinary pilgrim, climbed the
steps on his knees, until the Pope awaiting him at the top, raised
and embraced him. From the choir arose the exultant shout,
‘Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.’</p>

<p>A few days later, once more standing in St. Peter’s, Charlemagne
affixed his seal to the donation Pepin had given to the
Church. The document was entered amongst the papal
archives; but it has long since disappeared, and with it exact
information as to the territories concerned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Donation of Constantine</div>

<p>About this time the papal court produced another document,
the so-called ‘Donation of Constantine’, in which the first of
the Christian emperors apparently granted to the Popes the
western half of the Roman Empire. Centuries later this was
proved to be a forgery, but for a long while people accepted it
as genuine, and the power of the Popes was greatly increased.
We do not know how much Charles believed in papal supremacy
in temporal matters; but throughout his reign his attitude to the
Pope over Italian affairs was rather that of master to servant
than the reverse. It was only when spiritual questions were
under discussion that he was prepared to yield as if to a higher
authority.</p>

<p>When he had reduced Pavia Charlemagne left Lombardy to be
ruled by one of his sons and returned to France; but it was not
very long before he was called back to Italy, as fresh trouble had
arisen there. The cause was the unpopularity of Pope Leo III
in Rome and the surrounding country, where turbulent nobles
rebelled as often as they could against the papal government.
One day, as Leo was riding through the city at the head
of a religious procession, a band of armed men rushed out from
a side street, separated him from his attendants, dragged him
from his horse, and beat him mercilessly, leaving him half dead.
It was even said that they put out his eyes and cut off his tongue,
but that these were later restored by a miracle.</p>

<p>Leo, at any rate, whole though shaken, succeeded in reaching
Charlemagne’s presence, and the King was faced by the problem
of going to Rome to restore order. Had it been merely a matter
of exacting vengeance, he would have found little difficulty with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
his army of stalwart Franks behind him; but Leo’s enemies
were not slow in bringing forward accusations against their
victim that they claimed justified their assault. Charlemagne
was thus in an awkward position, for he was too honest a ruler to
refuse to hear both sides, and his respect for the papal office
could not blind him to the possibility of evil in the acts of the
person who held it, especially in the case of an ambitious
statesman like Leo III.</p>

<p>He felt that it was his duty to sift the matter to the bottom;
and yet by what law could the King of France or even of Italy
put Christ’s vice-regent upon his trial and cross-examine him?</p>

<p>One way of dealing with this problem would have been to seek
judgement at Constantinople as the seat of Empire, a final
‘appeal unto Caesar’ such as St. Paul had made in classical times:
but, ever since Pepin the Short had given the Exarchate of
Ravenna to the Pope instead of restoring it to Byzantine
Emperors, relations with the East, never cordial, had grown
more strained. Now they were at breaking point. The late
Emperor, a mere boy, had been thrown into a dungeon and
blinded by his mother, the Empress Irene, in order that she
might usurp his throne; and the Western Empire recoiled from
the idea of accepting such a woman as arbiter of their destinies.</p>

<p>Thus Charlemagne, forced to act on his own responsibility,
examined the evidence laid before him and declared Leo innocent
of the crimes of which he had been accused. In one sense it
was a complete triumph for the Pope; but Leo was a clear-sighted
statesman and knew that the power to which he had been
restored rested on a weak foundation. The very fact that he had
been compelled to appeal for justice to a temporal sovereign
lowered the office that he held in the eyes of the world; and he
possessed no guarantee that, once the Franks had left Rome,
his enemies would not again attack him. Without a recognized
champion, always ready to enforce her will, the Papacy remained
at the mercy of those who chose to oppose or hinder her.</p>

<p>In the dramatic scene that took place in St. Peter’s Cathedral
on Christmas Day, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 800, Leo found a way out of his difficulties.
Arrayed in gorgeous vestments, he said Mass before the High<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Altar, lit by a thousand candles hanging at the arched entrance
to the chancel. In the half-gloom beyond knelt Charlemagne
and his sons; and at the end of the service Leo, approaching
them with a golden crown in his hands, placed it upon the
King’s head. Instantly the congregation burst into the cry with
which Roman emperors of old had been acclaimed at their
accession. ‘To Charles Augustus, crowned of God, the great
and pacific Emperor, long life and victory!’ ‘From that time’,
says a Frankish chronicle, commenting on this scene, ‘there was
no more a Roman Empire at Constantinople.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foundation of Western Empire</div>

<p>Leo had found his champion, and in anointing and crowning
him had emphasized the dignity of his own office. He had also
pleased the citizens of Rome, who rejoiced to have an Emperor
again after the lapse of more than three centuries. Charlemagne
alone was doubtful of the greatness that had been thrust upon
him and accepted it with reluctance. He had troubles enough
near home without embroiling himself with Constantinople; but
as it turned out the Eastern Empire was too busy deposing the
Empress Irene to object actively to its rejection in the West; and
Irene’s successors agreed to acknowledge the imperial rank
of their rival in return for the cession of certain coveted lands on
the Eastern Adriatic.</p>

<p>Other sovereigns hastened to pay their respects to the new
Emperor, and Charlemagne received several embassies in search
of alliance from Haroun al-Raschid, the Caliph of Bagdad.
Haroun al-Raschid ruled over a mighty empire stretching from
Persia to Egypt, and thence along the North African coast to the
Strait of Gibraltar. On one occasion he sent Charlemagne a
present of a wonderful water-clock that, as it struck the hour of
twelve, opened as many windows, through which armed horsemen
rode forth and back again. Far more exciting in Western eyes
was the unhappy elephant that for nine years remained the
glory of the imperial court at Aachen. Its death, when they
were about to lead it forth on an expedition against the northern
tribes of Germany, is noted sadly in the national annals.</p>

<p>Rulers less fortunate than Haroun al-Raschid sought not
so much the friendship of the Western Emperor as his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
protection, and through his influence exiled kings of Wessex and
Northumberland were able to recover their thrones. Most
significant tribute of all to the honour in which Charlemagne’s
name was held was the petition of the Patriarch of Jerusalem
that he would come and rescue Christ’s city from the infidel.
The message was accompanied by a banner and the keys of the
Holy Sepulchre; but Charlemagne, though deeply moved
by such a call to the defence of Christendom, knew that
the campaign was beyond his power and put it from him. Were
there not infidels to be subdued within the boundaries of his own
Empire, fierce Saxon tribes that year after year made mock both
of the sovereignty of the Franks and their religion?</p>

<p>The Saxons lived amongst the ranges of low hills between the
Rhine and the Elbe. By the end of the eighth century, when
other Teutonic races such as the Franks and the Bavarians had
yielded to the civilizing influence of Christianity, they still
cherished their old beliefs in the gods of nature and offered
sacrifices to spirits dwelling in groves and fountains. The chief
object of their worship was a huge tree trunk that they kept
hidden in the heart of a forest, their priests declaring that the
whole Heavens rested upon it. This <i>Irminsul</i>, or ‘All-supporting
pillar’, was the bond between one group of Saxons and another
that led them to rally round their chiefs when any foreign army
appeared on their soil; though, if at peace with the rest of the
world, they would fight amongst themselves for sheer love
of battle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Boniface</div>

<p>A part of the Saxon race had settled in the island of Britain,
when the Roman authority weakened at the break-up of the
Empire; and amongst the descendants of these settlers were
some Christian priests who determined to carry the Gospel to
the heathen tribes of Germany, men and women of their own
race but still living in spiritual darkness. The most famous
of these missionaries was St. Winifrith, or St. Boniface according
to the Latin version of his name that means, ‘He who brings
peace.’</p>

<p>About the time that Charles Martel was Duke of the Franks
Boniface arrived in Germany and began to travel from one part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
of the country to another, explaining the Gospel of Christ, and
persuading those whom he converted to build churches and
monasteries. When he went to Rome to give an account of his
work the Pope made him a bishop and sent him to preach
in the Duchy of Bavaria. Later, as his influence increased and
he gathered disciples round him, he was able to found not only
parish churches but bishoprics with a central archbishopric
at Mainz; thus, long before Germany became a nation she
possessed a Church with an organized government that belonged
not to one but to all her provinces.</p>

<p>Only in the north and far east of Germany heathenism still
held sway; and St. Boniface, after he had gone at the Pope’s
wish to help the Franks reform their Church, determined to make
one last effort to complete his missionary work in the land
he had chosen as his own. He was now sixty-five, but nothing
daunted by the hardships and dangers of the task before him he
set off with a few disciples to Friesland and began to preach to
the wild pagan tribes who lived there. Before he could gain
a hearing, however, he was attacked, and, refusing to defend
himself, was put to death.</p>

<p>Thus passed away ‘the Apostle of Germany’ and with him
much of the kindliness of his message. Christianity was to come
indeed to these northern tribes, but through violence and the
sword rather than by the influence of a gentle life. Charlemagne
had a sincere love of the Catholic Faith, whose champion he
believed himself; but he considered that only folly and obstinacy
could blind men’s eyes to the truth of Christianity, and he was
determined to enforce its doctrines by the sword if necessary.</p>

<p>The Saxons, on the other hand, though if they were beaten in
battle they might yield for a time and might promise to pay
tribute to the Franks and build churches, remained heathens at
heart. When an opportunity occurred, and they learned that the
greater part of the Frankish army was in Italy or on the Spanish
border, they would sally forth across their boundaries and drive
out or kill the missionaries. Charlemagne knew that he could
have no peace within his Empire until he had subdued the
Saxons; but the task he had set himself was harder than he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
imagined, and it was thirty-eight years before he could claim that
he had succeeded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conquest of Saxon Tribes</div>

<p>‘The final conquest of the Saxons’, says Eginhard, a scholar
who lived at Charlemagne’s court and wrote his life, ‘would have
been accomplished sooner but for their treachery. It is hard to
tell how often they broke faith, surrendering to the King and
accepting his terms, and then breaking out into wild rebellion
once more.’ Eginhard continues that Charlemagne’s method
was never to allow a revolt to remain unpunished but to set out
at once with an army and exact vengeance. On one of these
campaigns he succeeded in reaching the forest where the sacred
trunk <i>Irminsul</i> was kept and set fire to it and destroyed it; but
the Saxons, though disheartened for the moment, soon rallied
under the banner of a famous chief called Witikind. We know
little of the latter except his undaunted courage that made him
refuse for many years to submit to a foe so much stronger that
he must obviously gain the final victory.</p>

<p>Charlemagne, exasperated by repeated opposition, used every
means to forward his aim. Sometimes he would bribe separate
chieftains to betray their side; but often he would employ
methods of deliberate cruelty in order to strike terror into his foes.
Four thousand five hundred Saxons who had started a rebellion
were once cut off and captured by the Franks. They pleaded
that Witikind, who had escaped into Denmark, had prompted
them to act against their better judgement. ‘If Witikind is not
here you must pay the penalty in his stead,’ returned the King
relentlessly, and the whole number were put to the sword.</p>

<p>At different times he transplanted hundreds of Saxon households
into the heart of France, and in the place of ‘this great
multitude’, as the chronicle describes them, he established
Frankish garrisons. He also sent missionaries to build churches
in the conquered territories and compelled the inhabitants to
become Christians.</p>

<p>Often the bishops and priests thus sent would have to fly
before a sudden raid of heathen Saxons hiding in the neighbouring
forests and marshes; and, lacking the courage of
St. Boniface, a few would hesitate to return when the danger was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
suppressed. ‘What ought I to do?’ cried one of the most
timid, appealing to Charlemagne. ‘In Christ’s name go back to
thy diocese,’ was the stern answer.</p>

<p>While the King expected the same obedience and devotion
from church officials as from the captains in his army, he took
care that they should not lack his support in the work he had set
them to do.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘If any man among the Saxons, being not yet baptized, shall
hide himself and refuse to come to baptism, let him die the death.’</p>

<p>‘If any man despise the Lenten fast for contempt of Christianity,
let him die the death.’</p>

<p>‘Let all men, whether nobles, free, or serfs, give to the
Churches and the priests the tenth part of their substance and
labour.’</p></blockquote>

<p>These ‘capitularies’, or laws, show that Charlemagne was still
half a barbarian at heart and matched pagan savagery with
a severity more ruthless because it was more calculating. In the
end Witikind himself, in spite of his courage, was forced
to surrender and accept baptism, and gradually the whole
of Saxony fell under the Frankish yoke.</p>

<p>The Duchy of Bavaria, that had been Christian for many years,
did not offer nearly so stubborn a resistance; and after he had
reduced both it and Saxony to submission, Charlemagne was
ruler not merely in name but in reality of an Empire that included
France, the modern Holland and Belgium, Germany, and the
greater part of Italy. Some of the conquests he had made were
to fall away, but Germany that had suffered most at his hands
emerged in the end the greatest achievement of his foreign wars.</p>

<span class="i0">And taught our race to know the only light,<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">wrote a Saxon monk of the ninth century, showing that already
some of the bitterness had vanished. ‘In a few generations’,
says a modern writer, ‘the Saxons were conspicuous for their
loyalty to the Faith.’</p>

<p>No story of Charlemagne would be true to life that omitted his
harsh dealings with his Saxon foe; and yet it would be equally
unfair to paint him only as a warrior, mercilessly exterminating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
all who opposed him in barbaric fashion. Far more than
a conqueror he was an empire-builder to whom war was not
an end in itself, as to his Frankish forefathers, but a means
towards the safeguarding of his realm.</p>

<p>The forts and outworks that he planted along his boundaries,
the churches that he built in the midst of hostile territory,
belonged indeed to his policy of inspiring terror and awe: but
Charlemagne had also other designs only in part of a military
nature. Roads and bridges that should make a network
of communication across the Empire, acting like channels
of civilization in assisting transport and encouraging trade and
intercourse: royal palaces that should become centres of justice
for the surrounding country: monasteries that should shed the
light of knowledge and of faith: all these formed part of his
dream of a Roman Empire brought back to her old stately life
and power.</p>

<p>A canal joining the Rhine and Danube and thus making
a continuous waterway between East and West was planned and
even begun, but had to wait till modern times for its completion.
Charlemagne possessed the vision and enterprise that did not
quail before big undertakings, but he lacked the money and
labour necessary for carrying them out. Unlike the Roman
Emperors of classic times he had no treasury on whose taxes he
could draw; but depended, save for certain rents, on the revenues
of his private estates that were usually paid ‘in kind’, that is to
say, not in coin but at the rate of so many head of cattle, or of so
much milk, corn, or barley, according to the means of the tenant.
Of these supplies he kept a careful account even to the number
of hens on the royal farms and the quantity of eggs that they
laid. Yet at their greatest extent revenues ‘in kind’ could do
little more than satisfy the daily needs of the palace.</p>

<p>The chief debt that the Frankish nation owed to the state was
not financial but military, the obligation of service in the field
laid on every freeman. As the Empire increased in size this
became so irksome that the system was somewhat modified. In
future men who possessed less than a certain quantity of land might
join together and pay one or two of their number, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
size of their joint properties, to represent them in the army
abroad, while the rest remained at home to see to the cultivation
of the crops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Court of Charlemagne</div>

<p>Charlemagne was very anxious to raise a body of labourers
from each district to assist in his building schemes, but this
suggestion awoke a storm of indignation. Landowners maintained
that they were only required by law to repair the roads
and bridges in their own neighbourhood, not to put their tenants
at the disposal of the Emperor that he might send them at his
whim from Aquitaine to Bavaria, or from Austria to Lombardy;
and in face of this opposition many of his designs ceased
abruptly from lack of labour. A royal palace and cathedral,
adorned with columns and mosaics from Ravenna, were, however,
completed at Aachen; and here Charlemagne established his
principal residence and gathered his court round him.</p>

<p>The life of this ‘new Rome’, as he loved to call it, was simple
in the extreme; for the Emperor, like a true Frank, hated
unnecessary ostentation and ceremony. When the chief nobles
and officials assembled twice a year in the spring and autumn to
debate on public matters, he would receive them in person,
thanking them for the gifts they had brought him, and walking
up and down amongst them to jest with one and ask questions
of another with an informality that would have scandalized the
court at Constantinople.</p>

<p>In this easy intercourse between sovereign and subject lay
the secret of Charlemagne’s personal magnetism. To warriors
and churchmen as to officials and the ordinary freemen of his
demesnes he was not some far-removed authority, who could be
approached only through a maze of court intrigue, but a man
like themselves with virtues and failings they could understand.</p>

<p>If his temper was hasty and terrible when roused, it would
soon melt away into a genial humour that appreciated to the
full the rough practical jokes in which the age delighted. The
chronicles tell us with much satisfaction how Charlemagne once
persuaded a Jew to offer a ‘vainglorious bishop ever fond
of vanities’ a painted mouse that he pretended he had brought
back straight from Judea. The bishop at first declined to give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
more than £3 for such a treasure; but, deceived by the Jew’s
prompt refusal to part with it for so paltry a sum, consented
at length to hand over a bushel of silver in exchange. The
Emperor, hearing this, gathered the rest of the bishops at his
court together&mdash;‘See what one of you has paid for a mouse!’ he
exclaimed gleefully; and we may be sure that the story did not
stop at the royal presence but spread throughout the country,
where haughty ecclesiastics were looked on with little favour.</p>

<p>We are told also that Charlemagne loved to bombard the
people he met, from the Pope downwards, with difficult questions;
but it was not merely a malicious desire to bring them to
confusion that prompted his inquiries. Alert himself, and
keenly interested in whatever business he had in hand, he
despised slipshod or inefficient knowledge. He expected a
bishop to be an authority on theology, an official to be an expert
on methods of government, a scholar to be well grounded in the
ordinary sciences of his day.</p>

<p>Hard work was the surest road to his favour, and he spared
neither himself nor those who entered his service. Even at
night he would place writing materials beneath his pillow that if
he woke or thought of anything it might be noted down. On
one occasion he visited the palace school that he had founded,
and discovered that while the boys of humble birth were making
the most of their opportunities, the sons of the nobles, despising
book-learning, had frittered away their time. Commending
those who had done well, the Emperor turned to the others with
an angry frown. ‘Relying on your birth and wealth,’ he
exclaimed, ‘and caring nothing for our commands and your own
improvement, you have neglected the study of letters and have
indulged yourselves in pleasures and idleness.... By the King
of Heaven I care little for your noble birth.... Know this, unless
straightway you make up for your former negligence by earnest
study, you need never expect any favour from the hand
of Charles.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Government of Charlemagne</div>

<p>It was with the wealthy nobles and landowners that Charlemagne
fought some of his hardest battles, though no sword
was drawn or open war declared. Not only were most of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
high offices at court in their hands, but it was from their
ranks that the counts, and later the viscounts, were chosen
who ruled over the districts into which the Empire was divided
and subdivided.</p>

<p>The count received a third of the gifts and rents from his
province that would have otherwise been paid to the King; and
these, if he were unscrupulous, he could increase at the expense
of those he governed. He presided in the local law-courts and
was responsible for the administration of justice, the exaction of
fines, and for the building of roads and bridges. He was in fact
a petty king, and would often tyrannize over the people and
neglect the royal interests to forward his selfish ambitions.</p>

<p>The Merovingians had tried to limit the authority of the
counts and other provincial officials by occasionally sending
private agents of their own to inquire into the state of the
provinces and to reform the abuses that they found. Charlemagne
adopted this practice as a regular system; and at the
annual assemblies he appointed <i>Missi</i>, or ‘messengers’, who
should make a tour of inspection in the district to which they
had been sent at least four times in the year and afterwards
report on their progress to the Emperor. Wherever they went
the count or viscount must yield up his authority to them
for the time being, allowing them to sit in his court and hear all
the grievances and complaints that the men and women of the
district cared to bring forward. If the <i>Missi</i> insisted on
certain reforms the count must carry them out and also make
atonement for any charges proved against him.</p>

<p>Here are some of the evils that the men of Istria, a province
on the Eastern Adriatic, suffered at the hands of their lord,
‘Johannes’, and that the inquiries of the royal <i>Missi</i> at length
brought to light. Johannes had sold the people on his estates
as serfs to his sons and daughters: he had forced them to build
houses for his family and to go voyages on his business across
the sea to Venice and Ravenna: he had seized the common land
and used it as his own, bringing in Slavs from across the border
to till it for his private use: he had robbed his tenants of their
horses and their money on the plea of the Emperor’s service<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
and had given them nothing in exchange. ‘If the Emperor will
help us,’ they cried, ‘we may be saved, but if not we had better
die than live.’</p>

<p>From this account we can see that Charlemagne appeared to
the mass of his subjects as their champion against the tyranny
of the nobles, and in this sense his government may be called
popular; but the old ‘popular’ assemblies of the Franks at
which the laws were made had ceased by this reign to be anything
but aristocratic gatherings summoned to approve of the
measures laid before them.</p>

<p>The Emperor’s ‘capitularies’ would be based on the advice
he had received from his most trusted <i>Missi</i>; and when they
had been discussed by the principal nobles, they would be read
to the general assembly and ratified by a formal acceptance that
meant nothing, because it rarely or never was changed into
a refusal.</p>

<p>Besides introducing new legislation in the form of royal edicts
or capitularies, Charlemagne commanded that a collection should
be made of all the old tribal laws, such as the Salic Law of the
Franks, and of the chief codes that had been handed down by
tradition, or word of mouth, for generations; and this compilation
was revised and brought up to date. It was a very useful and
necessary piece of work, yet Charlemagne for all his industry
does not deserve to be ranked as a great lawgiver like Justinian.
The very earnestness of his desire to secure immediate justice
made his capitularies hasty and inadequate. He would not wait
to trace some evil to its root and then try to eradicate it, but
would pass a number of laws on the matter, only touching the
surface of what was wrong and creating confusion by the multiplicity
of instructions and the contradictions they contained.</p>

<p>Sometimes the <i>Missi</i> themselves were not a success, but would
take bribes from the rich landowners on their tour of inspection,
and this would mean more government machinery and fresh
laws to bring them under the royal control in their turn. If it
was difficult to make wise laws, it was even harder in that rough
age to carry them out; for the nobles found it to their interest
to defy or at least hinder an authority that struck at their power;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
while the mass of the people were too ignorant to bear responsibility,
and few save those educated in the palace schools could
become trustworthy ‘counts’ or royal agents.</p>

<p>Dimly, however, the nation understood that the Emperor held
some high ideal of government planned for their prosperity,
‘No one cried out to him’, says the chronicle, ‘but straightway
he should have good justice’: and in every church throughout
France those who had not been called to follow him to battle
prayed for his safety and that God would subdue the barbarians
before his triumphant arms.</p>

<p>To Charlemagne there was a higher vision than that of mere
victory in battle, a vision born of his favourite book, the <cite>Civitas
Dei</cite>, wherein St. Augustine had described the perfect Emperor,
holding his sceptre as a gift God had given and might take away,
and conquering his enemies that he might lead them to a greater
knowledge and prosperity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charlemagne and the Church</div>

<p>Charlemagne believed that to him had been entrusted the
guardianship of the Catholic Church, not only from the heathen
without its pale, but from false doctrine and evil living within.
To the Pope, as Christ’s vice-regent, he bore himself humbly, as
on the day when he had climbed St. Peter’s steps on his knees,
but to the Pope as a man dealing with other men he spoke
as a lord to his vassal, tendering his views and expecting compliance,
in return for which he guaranteed the support of his sword.</p>

<p>‘May the ruler of the Church be rightly ruled by thee, O
King, and may’st thou be ruled by the right hand of the
Almighty!’ In this prayer Alcuin probably expressed the
Emperor’s opinion of his own position. Leo III, on the other
hand, preferred to talk of his champion as a faithful son of the
mother Church of Rome; thereby implying that the Emperor
should pay a son’s duty of obedience: but he himself was never
in a strong enough position to enforce this point of view, and
the clash of Empire and Papacy was left for a later age.</p>

<p>Within his own dominions Charlemagne, like the Frankish
kings before him, reigned supreme over the Church, appointing
whom he would as bishops, and using them often as <i>Missi</i> to
assist him in his government. Yet the Church remained an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
‘estate’ apart from the rest of the nation, supported by the
revenues of the large sees belonging to the different bishoprics
and by the <em>tithe</em>, or tenth part of a layman’s income. When
churchmen attended the annual assembly they were allowed
to deliberate apart from the nobles and freemen: when a bishop
excommunicated some heretic or sinner, the Emperor’s court was
bound to enforce the sentence. Thus the privileges and rights
were many; but Charlemagne determined that the men who
enjoyed them must also fulfil the obligations that they carried
with them.</p>

<p>In earlier years Charles Martel and St. Boniface had struggled
hard to raise the character of the Frankish Church, and Charlemagne
continued their task with his usual energy, insisting
on frequent inspections of the monasteries and convents and on
the maintenance of a stricter rule of life within their walls.</p>

<p>The ordinary parish clergy were also brought under more vigilant
supervision. In accordance with the laws of the Roman Church
they were not allowed to marry, nor might they take part in any
worldly business, enter a tavern, carry arms, or go hunting or
hawking. Above all they were encouraged to educate themselves
that they might be able to teach their parishioners and set
a good example.</p>

<p>‘Good works are better than knowledge’, wrote Charlemagne
to his bishops and abbots in a letter of advice, ‘but without
knowledge good works are impossible.’ In accordance with
this view he commanded that a school should be established
in every diocese, in order that the boys of the neighbourhood
might receive a grounding in the ordinary education of their day.
His own court became a centre of learning; for he himself was
keenly interested in all branches of knowledge, from a close
study of the Scriptures to mathematics or tales of distant lands.
Histories he liked to have read out to him at meals. Eginhard,
his biographer, tells us that he never learned to write, but that he
was proficient in Latin and could understand Greek.</p>

<p>It was his desire to emulate Augustus, the first of the Roman
Emperors, and gather round him the most literary men of
Europe, and he eagerly welcomed foreign scholars and took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
them into his service. Chief amongst these adopted sons of the
Empire was Alcuin the Northumbrian, a ‘wanderer on the face
of the earth’ as he called himself, whom Danish invasions had
driven from his native land.</p>

<p>Alcuin settled at the Frankish court, organized the ‘palace
school’ of which we have already made mention, and himself
wrote the primers from which the boys were taught. His
influence soon extended beyond this sphere, and he became the
Emperor’s chief adviser, inspiring his master with high ideals,
while he himself was stirred by the other’s vivid personality
to share his passion for hard work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of Charlemagne</div>

<p>It is this almost volcanic energy that gives the force and charm
to Charlemagne’s many-sided character. We think of him first,
it may be, as the warrior, the hero of romance, or else as a statesman
planning his Empire of the West. At another time we see
in him the guardian of his people, the king who ‘wills that
justice should be done’, but we recall a story such as that of the
painted mouse, and instantly his simple, almost schoolboy, side
becomes apparent. The ‘Great Charles’ was no saint but
a Frank of the rough type of soldiers he led to battle, capable
of cruelty as of kindness, hot-tempered, a lover of sport, strong
perhaps where his ideals were at stake, but weak towards women,
and an over-indulgent father, who let the intrigues of his
daughters bring scandal on his court. Yet another contrast to
this homely figure is the scholar and theologian, the friend of
Alcuin, who believed that without knowledge good works were
impossible.</p>

<p>Many famous characters in history have equalled or surpassed
Charlemagne as general, statesman, or legislator&mdash;there have
been better scholars and more refined princes&mdash;but few or none
have followed such divers aims and achieved by the sheer force
of their personality such memorable results. Painters and
chroniclers love to depict him in old age still majestic; and in
truth up till nearly the end of his long reign he kept the fire
and vigour of his youth, swimming like a boy in the baths of
Aachen, or hunting the wild boar upon the hills, drawing up
capitularies, or dictating advice to his bishops, doing, in fact,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
whatever came to hand with an intensity that would have
exhausted any one less healthy and self-reliant.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Charlemagne he had the sturdy constitution
of his race, and when at last he died an old man in 814 people
believed that he did not share the common fate of humanity.
Nearly two hundred years later, it was said, when the funeral
vault was opened, he was found seated in his chair of state,
firm of flesh as in life, with his crown on his snowy hair, and his
sword clasped in his hand.</p>

<p>‘Our Lord gave this boon to Charlemagne that men should
speak of him as long as the world endureth.’ It is a boast that
as centuries pass, sweeping away the memory of lesser heroes,
time still justifies.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE INVASIONS OF THE NORTHMEN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>At the death of Charlemagne the Empire that he had built up
stretched from Denmark to the Pyrenees and the Duchy of
Spoletum south of Rome, from the Atlantic on the West to the
Baltic, Bohemia, and the Dalmatian coast. It had been a brave
attempt to realize the old Roman ideal of all civilized Europe
gathered under one ruler; but he himself was well aware that
the foundations he had laid were weak, his own personality that
must vanish the mortar holding them together. Without his
genius and the terror of his name his possessions were only too
likely to fall away; and therefore, instead of attempting to leave
a united Empire, he nominated one son to be emperor in name,
but made a rough division of his territory between three. Only
the death of two just before his own defeated his aims and united
the inheritance under the survivor, Louis.</p>

<p>The new Emperor was like his father in build, but without his
wideness of outlook. His natural geniality was sometimes
marred by uncontrollable fits of suspicion and cruelty, as in the
case of his nephew, Bernard, King of Italy, whom he believed
to be secretly conspiring to bring about his overthrow. Louis
ordered the young man to appear at his court, and when
Bernard hesitated, fearing treachery, his uncle sent him a special
promise of safety by the Empress, whom he trusted. Reluctantly
Bernard at last obeyed the summons, whereupon he was seized,
thrust into a dungeon, and his eyes put out so cruelly that he
died. Shortly afterwards the Empress died also, and Louis
who had loved her believed that God was punishing him for his
broken word. Overcome by remorse he became so devout in his
religious observances that his subjects called him ‘Louis the
Pious’.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Louis, like his father, was ever ready to listen to the petitions
of those who were oppressed and to pass laws for their security.
For the first sixteen years of his reign the Carolingian dominions,
put to no test, appeared unshaken, and then of a sudden, just as
if a cloud were blotting out the sunlight, prosperity and peace
were lost in the horrors of civil war.</p>

<p>Louis the Pious had three sons by his first wife, and following
Charlemagne’s example he named the eldest, Lothar, as his
successor in the Empire, while he divided his lands between the
other two. It was only when he married again and another
son, Charles, was born to him that trouble began. This fourth
son was the old Emperor’s favourite, and Louis would gladly
have left him a large kingdom; but such a gift he could only
make now at the expense of the elder brothers, who hated the
young boy as an interloper, and were determined that he should
receive nothing to which they could lay a claim.</p>

<p>When Charles was six years old Louis insisted that the
country now called Switzerland and part of modern Germany
(Suabia) should be recognized as his inheritance; and on
hearing this all three elder brothers, who had been secretly
making disloyal plots, broke into open revolt.</p>

<p>The history of the next ten years is an ignominious chronicle
of the Emperor’s weakness. Twice were he and his Empress
imprisoned and insulted; and on each occasion, when the
quarrels of his sons amongst themselves led to his release, he
was induced to grant a weak forgiveness that led to further
rebellion.</p>

<p>When Louis died in 840, the seeds of dissension were widely
scattered; and those of his House who came after him openly
showed that they cared for nothing save personal ambition.
Lothar, the eldest, was proclaimed Emperor, and obtained as
his share of the dominions a large middle kingdom stretching
from the mouth of the Rhine to Italy, and including the two
capitals of Aachen and Rome. To the East, in what is now
Germany, reigned his brother Louis, to the West, in France,
Charles ‘the Bald’, the hated younger brother who had
succeeded at the last in obtaining a substantial inheritance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Oath of Strasbourg</div>

<p>This division is interesting because it shows two of the
nationalities of Europe already emerging from the imperial
melting-pot. When the brothers Louis and Charles met at
Strasbourg in 842 to confirm an alliance they had formed against
Lothar, Charles and his followers took the oath in German,
Louis and his nobles in the Romance tongue of which modern
French is the descendant. This they did that the armies on both
sides might clearly understand how their leaders had bound
themselves, and the Oath of Strasbourg remains to-day as
evidence of this new growth of nationality that had already
acquired distinct national tongues.</p>

<p>The Partition of Verdun, signed shortly afterwards by all three
brothers, acknowledged the division of the Empire into three
parts, France on the West, Germany in the East, and between
them the debatable kingdom of Lotharingia, that, dwindled
during the Middle Ages and modern times into the province of
Lorraine, has remained always a source of war and trouble.</p>

<p>It would be wearisome to trace in detail the history of the
years that followed the Partition of Verdun. One historian has
described it as ‘a dizzy and unintelligible spectacle of monotonous
confusion, a scene of unrestrained treachery, of insatiable
and blind rapacity. No son is obedient or loyal to his father,
no brother can trust his brother, no uncle spares his nephew....
There were rapid alterations in fortune, rapid changing of sides,
there was universal distrust and universal reliance on falsehood
or crime.’</p>

<p>In 881 Charles ‘the Fat’, son of Louis the German, of Strasbourg
Oath fame, succeeded, owing to the deaths of his rival
cousins and uncles, in uniting for a few years all the dominions
of Charlemagne under his sceptre; but, weak and unhealthy, he
was not the man to control so great possessions, and very shortly
he was deposed and died in prison on an island in Lake
Constance. With him faded away the last reflection of the
Carolingian glory that had once dazzled the world. In France
the descendants of Charles ‘the Bald’ carried on a precarious
existence for several generations, despised and threatened by
their own nobles, as the later Merovingians had been, and utterly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
unable to defend their land from the hostile invasions of Northmen,
that, beginning in the eighth century, seemed likely during
the ninth and tenth centuries to paralyse the civilization and
trade of Europe as the inroads of Goths, Huns, and Vandals had
broken up the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>The long ships of the Northmen had been seen off the French
coasts even in the days of Charlemagne, and one of the chroniclers
records how the wise king seeing them exclaimed, ‘These vessels
bear no merchandise but cruel foes,’ and then continued, with
prophetic grief, ‘Know ye why I weep? Truly I fear not that
these will injure me; but I am deeply grieved that in my lifetime
they should be so near a landing on these shores, and
I am overwhelmed with sorrow as I look forward and see what
evils they will bring upon my offspring and their people.’</p>

<p>The Northmen, we can guess from their name, came from the
wild, often snow-bound, coasts of Scandinavia and Denmark.
Few weaklings could survive in such a climate; and the race
was tall, well built, and hardy, made up of men and women who
despised the fireside and loved to feel the fresh sea-wind beating
against their faces. Life to them was a perpetual struggle,
but a struggle they had glorified into an ideal, until they had
ceased to dread either its discomforts or dangers.</p>

<p>Here is a description of the three classes, thrall, churl, and
noble, into which these tribes of Northmen, or ‘Vikings’, were
divided.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Thrall was swarthy of skin, his hands wrinkled, his knuckles
bent, his fingers thick, his face ugly, his back broad, his heels
long. He began to put forth his strength binding bast, making
loads, and bearing home faggots the weary day long. His
children busied themselves with building fences, dunging ploughland,
tending swine, herding goats, and digging peat.... Carl,
or Churl, was red and ruddy, with rolling eyes, and took to
breaking oxen, building ploughs, timbering houses, and making
carts. Earl, the noble, had yellow hair, his cheeks were rosy,
his eyes were keen as a young serpent’s. His occupation was
shaping the shield, bending the bow, hurling the javelin, shaking
the lance, riding horses, throwing dice, fencing and swimming.
He began to wake war, to redden the field, and to fell the
doomed.’</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
‘To wake war.’ This was the object of the Viking’s
existence. His gods, ‘Odin’ and ‘Thor’, were battle heroes
who struck one another in the flash of lightning and with the
rumble of thunder as they moved their shields. Not for the
man who lived long and comfortably and died at last in his bed
were either the glory of this world or the joys of the next. The
Scandinavian ‘Valhalla’ was no such ‘paradise’ as the faithful
Moslems conceived, where, in sunlit gardens gay with fruit and
flowers, he should rest from his labours, attended by ‘houris’,
or maidens of celestial beauty. The Viking asked for no rest,
only for unfailing strength and a foe to kill. In the halls of his
paradise reigned perpetual battle all the day long, and, in the evening,
feasts where the warrior, miraculously cured of his wounds,
could boast of his prowess and rise again on the morrow to fresh
deeds of heroic slaughter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Northmen Raids</div>

<p>In their dragon-ships, the huge prows fashioned into the heads
of fierce animals or monsters, the Viking ‘Earls’, weary of
dicing and throwing the javelin at home, or exiled by their
kings for some misdeeds, would sweep in fleets across the North
Sea, some to explore Iceland and the far-off shores of Greenland
and North America, some to burn the monasteries along the
Irish coast, others to raid North Germany, France, or England.
At first their only object was plunder, for unlike the Huns they
did not despise the luxuries of civilization&mdash;only those who
allowed its influence to make them ‘soft’. At a later date, when
they met with little resistance, they began to build homes, and
thus the east coast of England became settled with Danish
colonies.</p>

<p>‘In this year’, says the <cite>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</cite>, writing under
the date 855, ‘the heathen men for the first time remained over
winter in Sheppey.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alfred the Great</div>

<p>During the fifty years that followed it seemed as if the invaders
might sweep away the Anglo-Saxons as completely as the
ancestors of these Anglo-Saxons had exterminated the original
British inhabitants and their Roman conquerors. That they
failed was largely due to one of the most famous of English kings,
Alfred ‘the Great’, a prince of the royal house of Wessex.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
Wessex was a province lying mainly to the south of the River
Thames, and at Wantage in Berkshire in the year 849 Alfred
was born, cradled in an atmosphere of war and danger. From
boyhood he fought by the side of his brothers in a long campaign
of which the very victories could not hold at bay the restless
Danes. When Alfred succeeded to the throne he secured a
temporary peace and began to build a fleet and reform his army;
but in a few years his enemies broke across his boundaries once
more, and he himself, overwhelmed by their numbers, was forced
to take refuge in the marshes of Somerset. Here at Athelney he
built a fort and, collecting round him the English warriors of the
neighbouring counties, organized so strong a resistance that at
last he inflicted a decisive defeat upon the Danish army. King
Guthrum, his enemy, sued for peace and at the Treaty of
Wedmore consented to become a Christian and to recognize
Alfred as King of Wessex, while he himself retained the Danelaw
to the north of the Thames.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of a new England, for from this time
Alfred and his descendants, having secured the freedom of
Wessex, set themselves to win back bit by bit the territory held
by the Danes. First of all under Edward ‘the Elder’, Alfred’s
son, the middle kingdom of Mercia was won back, and the Danes
beyond its border agreed to recognize the King of Wessex as
their overlord, while later other Wessex rulers overran
Northumbria and the South of Scotland, so that by the middle of
the tenth century it could be said that ‘England from the Forth
to the Channel was under one ruler’.</p>

<p>The winning back of the Danelaw had not been merely
a matter of hewing down Northmen, nor did Alfred earn his
title of ‘the Great’ because he could wield a sword bravely and
lead other men who could do the same. He was a successful
general because in an age of wild fighting he recognized the
value of discipline and training. In order to obtain the type of
men he required he increased the number of ‘Thegns’, that is, of
nobles whose duty it was to serve the King as horsemen, while
he reorganized the ‘fyrd’ or local militia. Henceforth, instead of
a large army of peasants, who must be sent to their homes every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
autumn to reap the harvest, he arranged for the maintenance of
a small force that he could keep in the field as long as required.
Its arms were to be supplied by fellow villagers released from
the obligation to serve themselves on this condition.</p>

<p>Alfred, besides remodelling his army, set up fortresses along
his borders, and constructed a fleet; and, because he believed
that no great nation can be built on war alone, he made wise
laws and appointed judges, like Charlemagne’s <i>Missi</i>, to see that
they were carried out. He also founded schools and tried, by
translating books himself and inviting scholars to his court, to
teach the men around him the glories and interests of peace.
Amongst the books that he chose to set before his people in
the Anglo-Saxon tongue was one called <cite>Pastoral Care</cite>, by the
Pope Gregory who had wished to go to England as a missionary,
and <cite>The Consolations of Philosophy</cite>, written by Boethius in
prison.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>‘I have desired,’ said Alfred the Great, summing up his ideal
of life, ‘to leave to the men who come after me my memory in
good works’; and English people to-day, descendants of both
Anglo-Saxons and their Danish foes, remember with pride and
affection this ‘Wise King’, this ‘Truth-teller’, this ‘England’s
darling’, as he was called in his own day, who like Charlemagne
believed in patriotism, justice, and knowledge. For three-quarters
of a century after Alfred’s death his descendants
kept alive something at any rate of this spirit of greatness, but
in 978 there succeeded to the crown a boy of ten called Ethelred,
who as he grew up earned for himself the nickname of ‘rede-less’
or ‘man without advice’.</p>

<p>It is only fair before condemning Ethelred’s conduct to point
out the heavy difficulties with which he was faced; both the
renewed Danish attacks on his shores, and also the jealousies
and feuds of his own nobles, the Earls, or ‘Ealdormen’, who had
carved out large estates for themselves that they ruled as petty
kings. Even a statesman like Alfred would have needed all his
strength and tact to unite these powerful subjects under one
banner in order to lead them against the invaders. Ethelred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
proved himself weak and without any power of leadership. The
policy for which he has been chiefly remembered is his levy of
a tax called ‘Danegeld’, or Danish gold, the sums of money that
he raised from his reluctant subjects to pay the Danes to go
away. As a wiser man would have realized, this really meant
that he paid them to return in still larger numbers in order to
obtain more money. At last, alarmed at the result of this policy,
he did something still more short-sighted and less defensible:
he ordered a general massacre of all the Danes in the kingdom.</p>

<p>The Massacre of St. Brice’s Day, as this drastic measure is
usually called, brought on England a bitter revenge at the hands
of the angry Vikings. One well-armed force after another landed
on the coasts, combining in an attack on the Anglo-Saxon
King that drove him from the country to seek refuge in France.
Very shortly afterwards he died, and Cnut, one of the Danish
leaders, forced the country to accept him as her ruler.</p>

<p>This accession of a Danish foe might have been expected to
undo all the work of Alfred and his sons, but fortunately for
England Cnut was no reckless Viking with his heart set on war
for war’s sake. On the contrary, he was by nature a statesman
who planned the foundation of a northern Empire with England
as its central point. He maintained a bodyguard of Danish
‘Hus carls’ supported by a tax levied on his new subjects in order
to ensure his personal safety and the fulfilment of his orders,
but otherwise he showed himself an Englishman in every way
he could. In especial he made large gifts to monasteries and
convents, bestowed favour and lands on English nobles, and
accepted the laws and customs of the country whose throne he
had usurped. King of Denmark, and conqueror of England and
Norway, he was anxious to ally his Empire with the nations of
the Continent. With this in view he went on a pilgrimage to
Rome to win the sympathy of the Pope and took a great deal of
trouble to arrange foreign alliances. He himself married Emma,
widow of Ethelred ‘the Rede-less’, and a sister of the Duke of
Normandy, thus pleasing the English and bringing himself into
touch with France.</p>

<p>The mention of Normandy brings us to a second invasion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Northmen, for the Normans, like Cnut himself, were of Scandinavian
origin. When some of the Vikings during the ninth
century had sailed up the Humber and the Thames in the search
of plunder and homes, others, as Charlemagne, according to the
chronicler, had foreseen, preferred the harbours of the Seine,
the Somme, and the Loire. In their methods they showed the
same reckless daring and brutality as the early invaders of
England, leaving where they passed smoking ruins of towns
and churches.</p>

<p>Charles ‘the Bald’ and the feeble remnant of the Carolingian
line who succeeded him were quite unable to deal with this
terror, and it was only the creation of a Duchy of Paris, whose
forces were commanded by a fighting hero, Odo Capet, that
saved the future capital of France.</p>

<p>‘History repeats itself,’ it is sometimes said; and certainly the
fate that the Carolingian ‘Mayors of the Palace’ had meted out
to their Merovingian kings their own descendants were destined
to receive again in full measure.</p>

<p>In 987 died Louis ‘the Good-for-nothing’, the last of the
Carolingian kings, leaving as heir to the throne an uncle, Charles,
Duke of Lorraine. In his short reign Louis had shown himself
feeble and profligate; and the nobles of northern France,
weary of a royal House that like Ethelred of England preferred
bribing the goodwill of invaders to fighting them, readily agreed
to set Charles on one side and to take in his place Hugh Capet,
Duke of Paris, descendant of the famous Odo.</p>

<p>‘Our crown goes not by inheritance,’ exclaimed the Archbishop
of Reims, when sanctioning the usurper’s claims, ‘but
by wisdom and noble blood.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The House of Capet</div>

<p>The unfortunate Duke of Lorraine, captured after a vain
attempt to gain his inheritance, perished in prison, and with him
disappeared the Carolingians. The House of Capet, built on
their ruin, survived in the direct line until the fourteenth century,
and then in a younger branch, the Valois, until France in modern
times was declared a republic.</p>

<p>Under the Capets France became not merely a collection of
tribes and races as under the Merovingians, nor a section of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
a European Empire as under the House of Charlemagne, but
a nation as we see her to-day, with separate interests and customs
to distinguish her from other nations. This process of fusion
was slow, and King Hugh and his immediate successors appeared
in their own day more as powerful rulers of the small district in
which they lived than as overlords of France. When they
marched abroad at the head of a large army, achieving victories,
outlying provinces hastily recognized them as suzerains, or overlords,
but when they turned their backs and went home, the
commands they had issued would be ignored and defied.</p>

<p>Amongst the most formidable neighbours of these rulers of
Paris were the Dukes of Normandy, descendants of a certain
Viking chief, Rollo ‘the Ganger’, so called because on account
of his size he could find no horse capable of bearing him and
must therefore ‘gang afoot’. This Rollo established himself at
Rouen, and because Charles ‘the Simple’, one of the later
Carolingians,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> was unable to defeat him in battle he gave him
instead the lands which he had won, and created him Duke,
hoping that like a poacher turned gamekeeper he might prove
as valuable a subject as he had been a troublesome foe. In return
Rollo promised to become a Christian and to acknowledge
Charles as his overlord. One of the old chronicles says that
when Rollo was asked to ratify this allegiance by kissing his toe,
the Viking replied indignantly, ‘Not so, by God!’ and that
a Dane who consented to do so in his place was so rough that he
tumbled Charles from his throne amid the jeers of his companions.</p>

<p>This is probably only a tale, for in reality Rollo married
a daughter of Charles and settled down in his capital at Rouen
as the model ruler of a semi-civilized state, supporting the
Church, and administering such law and order that it was said
when he left a massive bracelet hanging on a tree and forgot he
had done so, that the ornament remained for three years without
any one daring to steal it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William the Conqueror</div>

<p>The rulers of the new Duchy were nearly all strong men, hard
fighters, shrewd-headed, and ambitious; but the greatest of the
line was undoubtedly William, an illegitimate son of Duke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Robert ‘the Devil’. William’s ambition was of the restless type
of his Scandinavian forefathers, and his duchy in northern
France seemed to him too small to match his hopes. When he
noted that England was ruled by Edward ‘the Confessor’, a feeble
son of Ethelred ‘the Rede-less’, who had gained the throne on
the death of Cnut’s two sons, he determined shrewdly that his
conquests should lie in this direction. Many things favoured
his cause, not the least that Edward the Confessor himself, who
had been brought up in Normandy and who had no direct
heirs, was quite willing to acknowledge William as his successor.</p>

<p>The national hero of England at the time Edward died, and
who promptly proclaimed himself king, was Harold the Saxon,
a member of the powerful family of Godwin that had for years
controlled and owned the greater part of the land in the south.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Harold the north and midlands were mainly
governed by the House of Morkere and their friends, who hated
the family of Godwin as dangerous rivals far more than they
dreaded a Norman invasion. Thus any help that they or their
tenants proffered was so slow in its rendering and so niggardly
in its amount that it proved of very little use.</p>

<p>In addition to jealousies at home, Harold, at the moment that
he heard William, Duke of Normandy, had indeed landed on the
south coast, was far off in Yorkshire, where he had just
succeeded in repelling an invasion of Danes at the battle of
Stamford Bridge. At once he started southwards, but as he
marched his army melted away, some of the men to enjoy the
spoils taken from the Danes, others to attend to their harvests.</p>

<p>The deserters could claim that they were following the advice
of the Father of Christendom, since Pope Gregory VII had
given William a banner that he had blessed and had denounced
Harold as a perjurer.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for Gregory’s anger with the Saxons was
that Harold had dared to appoint as Archbishop of Canterbury
a bishop of whom he did not approve, while further the crafty
William had persuaded him that Harold, who as a young man
had been wrecked upon the Norman coast, had sworn on the
bones of some holy saint that he would never seize the crown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
of England. He had been a prisoner in William’s power and
only on this condition had he been set free to return to his
native land.</p>

<p>The exact truth of events so long ago is hard to reach; but
Harold, at any rate, fought under a cloud of suspicion and neglect,
and not all his reckless daring, nor the devotion of his brothers
and friends, could save his fortunes when on the field of Senlac,
standing beneath his dragon-banner, he met the shock of the
disciplined Norman forces. Chroniclers relate that the human
wall of Saxon archers and foot-soldiers remained unshaken on
the hill-side until William, setting a snare, turned in pretended
flight. The ruse was successful; for as the Saxons, cheering
triumphantly, descended from their position in pursuit, the invaders
faced round and charged their disordered ranks. Only
Harold and the men of his bodyguard remained firm under the
onslaught, until at the last an arrow fired in the air struck the
Saxon King in the eye as he looked up, so that he fell down
dead. All resistance was now at an end and William, Duke of
Normandy, was left master of the field and ruler of England.</p>

<p>These lines of Tennyson on ‘Battle Abbey’ recall the fact
that just as the Danes and Saxons were fused into one race, so
would the Norman invaders mingle with their descendants, until
to after-generations William as well as Harold should appear a
national hero.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Domesday Book</div>

<p>In his own day ‘the Conqueror’ struck terror into the heart
of the conquered. In 1069, when the North of England, too late
to help Harold, rose in revolt, he laid waste a desert by sword
and fire from the Humber to the Tees. When the Norman
barons and English earls challenged his rule he threw them
alike into dungeons. What seemed to the Saxon mind even
more wonderful and horrible than his cruelty was the record
of all the wealth of his kingdom that he caused to be compiled.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
This ‘Domesday Book’ contained a close account not only of the
great estates, lay and ecclesiastical, but of every small hamlet,
and even of the number of live stock on each farm.</p>

<p>‘So very narrowly did he cause the survey to be made,’ says
the <cite>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</cite>, ‘that there was not a single hide
nor a rood of land, nor (it is shameful to relate that which he
thought no shame to do) was there an ox, or a cow, or a pig,
passed by that was not set down in the account.’</p>

<p>William, it can be seen, was thorough in his methods, both in war
and peace, and through this very thoroughness he won the
respect if not the affection of his new subjects. Ever since the
death of Cnut the Dane, England had suffered either from
actual civil war or from a weak ruler who allowed his nobles to
quarrel and oppress the rest of the nation. As a result of the
Norman Conquest the bulk of the population found that they had
gained one tyrant instead of many; and how they appreciated
the change is shown by the way, all through Norman times, the
middle and lower classes would help their foreign king against
his turbulent baronage.</p>

<p>This is what a monk, an Anglo-Saxon, and therefore by
race an enemy of the Conqueror, wrote about him in his
chronicle:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘If any would know what manner of man King William
was ... then will we describe him as we have known him....
This King William ... was a very wise and a great man, and
more honoured and more powerful than any of his predecessors.
He was mild to those good men who loved God, but severe
beyond measure to those who withstood his will.... So also he
was a very stern and wrathful man, so that none durst do
anything against his will, and he kept in prison those Earls who
acted against his pleasure. He removed bishops from their
sees ... and at length he spared not his own brother Odo.</p>

<p>‘Amongst other things the good order that William established
must not be forgotten; it was such that any man who was
himself aught might travel over the kingdom with a bosom full
of gold unmolested, and no man durst kill another, however
great the injury he might have received from him.’</p></blockquote>

<p>A few lines farther on the chronicler, having mentioned the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
peace that William gave, sadly relates the tyranny that was the
price he extorted in exchange:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Truly there was much trouble in these times and very great
distress; he caused castles to be built and oppressed the poor....
He was given to avarice and greedily loved gain. He made
large forests for the deer, and enacted laws therewith, so that
whoever killed a hart or a hind should be blinded ..., he loved
the tall stags as if he were their father. He also appointed
concerning the hares that they should go free. The rich
complained and the poor murmured, but he was so sturdy that
he recked nought of them; they must will all that the king
willed if they would live.... Alas that any man should so exalt
himself.... May Almighty God show mercy to his soul!’</p></blockquote>

<p>The monk wrote after September 1087, when the Conqueror
lay dead. Not in any Viking glory of battle against a national
foe had he passed to his fathers, but in sordid struggle with his
eldest son Robert who, aided by the French king, had rebelled
against him. His crown was at once seized by his second son
William Rufus, and with him the line of Norman kings was
firmly established on the English throne.</p>

<p>The adventurous spirit of the Northmen had led them from
Denmark and Scandinavia to the coasts of England and France;
and from France their descendants, driven by the same roving
instincts, had crossed the Channel in search of fresh conquests.
Other Normans in the eleventh century sailed south instead
of north. Their talk was of a pilgrimage to Rome, perhaps to
the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem; but when they found that the
beautiful island of Sicily had been taken by the Moslems, and
that South Italy was divided up amongst a number of princes
too jealous of one another to unite against any invaders either
Christian or pagan, their thoughts turned quite naturally to
conquest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Norman Conquests in Italy</div>

<p>An Italian of this time describes the Normans as ‘cunning
and revengeful’, and adds: ‘In their eager search for wealth
and dominion they despise whatever they possess and hope
whatever they desire.’ Such an impression was to be gained by
bitter experience; but not knowing it, Maniaces, the Greek
governor of that part of South Italy that still maintained its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
allegiance to the Eastern Empire, invited these Northern
warriors in the eleventh century to help him win back Sicily
from the Saracens. They agreed, attacked in force, gained the
greater part of the island, but then quarrelled with Maniaces
over the spoils. Outraged by what they considered his miserly
conduct, they invaded the province of Apulia, made themselves
master of it, and established their capital at Melfi.</p>

<p>The head of the new Norman state was a certain William de
Hauteville, who with several of his brothers had been leaders in
the Italian expedition.</p>

<p>‘No member of the House of Hauteville ever saw a neighbour’s
lands without wanting them for himself.’ So says a biographer
of that family; and if this was their ideal it was certainly shared
by William and his numerous brothers. Since other people’s
possessions were not surrendered without a struggle, even in
the Middle Ages, it was fortunate for them that they had the
genius to win and hold what they coveted.</p>

<p>Pope Leo IX, like his predecessors in the See of Peter ever
since Charlemagne had confirmed their right to the lands of the
Exarch of Ravenna,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> looked uneasily on invaders of Italy, and
he therefore attempted to form a league with both the Emperors
of the East and West that should ruin these presumptuous
usurpers. The league came into being, but the Pope’s allies
failed him, and at the battle of Civitate he was defeated and all
but taken prisoner.</p>

<p>Here was a chance for Norman diplomacy, or, as Italians
would have called it, ‘cunning’, and the conquerors promptly
declared that it had been with the utmost reluctance that they had
made war on the Father of Christendom, and begged his forgiveness.
His absolution was obtained, and a few years later,
through the mediation of Hildebrand, then Archdeacon of Rome
and later as Pope Gregory VII, one of the leading statesmen
of Europe, a compact was arranged by which the Normans
recognized Pope Nicholas II as their overlord, while he, on his
part, acknowledged their right to keep their conquests. Both
parties to this bargain were pleased: the Pope because he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
gained a vassal state however unruly, the Normans since they
felt that they no longer reigned on sufferance, but had a legal
status in the eyes of Europe. Neither had any idea of the mine
of trouble they were laying for future generations.</p>

<p>The fortunes of the House of Hauteville, thus established,
mounted steadily. William died and was succeeded by a younger
brother, Robert, nicknamed ‘Guiscard’ or ‘the Wise’. During
his reign he forced both the Greek governor and the independent
princes who held the rest of South Italy to surrender their
possessions, while he even carried his war against the Eastern
Empire to Greece itself. Only his death put an end to this
daring campaign.</p>

<p>Robert Guiscard, as master of South Italy, had been created
Duke of Apulia; his nephew, Roger II, Count of Sicily, who
inherited his statecraft and strength, induced the Pope to magnify
both mainland and island into a joint kingdom, and thereafter
reigned as King of Naples. ‘He was a lover of justice’, says a
chronicler of his day, ‘and a most severe avenger of crime. He
hated lying ... and never promised what he did not mean to
perform. He never persecuted his private enemies, and in war
endeavoured on all occasions to gain his point without shedding
blood. Justice and peace were universally observed through
his dominions.’</p>

<p>Roger II of Naples was evidently a finer and more civilized
character than William of England; but in both lay that Norman
capacity for establishing and maintaining order that at first
seems so strange an inheritance from wild Norse ancestors.
Clear-sighted, iron-nerved, an adventurer with an instinct for
business, the Norman of the Early Middle Ages was just the
leaven that Europe required to raise her out of the indolent
depression of the ‘Dark Ages’ that followed the fall of Rome.</p>

<span class="subhead">FEUDALISM AND MONASTICISM</span></h2>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Feudalism</span></h3>

<p>Wherever in the course of history men have gathered
together they have gradually evolved some form of association
that would ensure mutual interests. It might be merely the
tribal bond of the Arabians, by which a man’s relations were
responsible for his acts and avenged his wrongs; it might be a
council of village elders such as the Russian ‘Mir’, making laws
for the younger men and women; it might be a group of German
chiefs legislating on moonlit nights, according to the description
of Tacitus, by their camp fires.</p>

<p>In contrast to primitive associations stands the elaborate
government of Rome under Augustus and his successors; the
despotic Emperor, his numberless officials, the senators with
their huge estates, the struggling <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">curiales</i>, the army of legions
carrying out the imperial commands from Scotland to the
Euphrates. When Rome fell, her government, like a house
whose foundations have collapsed, fell also. Barbarian conquerors,
established in Italy and the Roman provinces, took
what they liked of the laws that they found, added to them their
own customs, and out of the blend evolved new codes of legislation.
Yet legislation, without some method of ensuring
its execution, could not save nations from invasion nor the
merchant or peasant from becoming the victim of robberies and
petty crimes.</p>

<p>Mediaeval centuries are sometimes called the Age of Feudalism,
because during this time feudalism was the method gradually
adopted for dealing with the problems of public life amongst all
classes in nearly all the nations of Europe. There are two
chief things to be remembered about feudalism&mdash;first that it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
no sudden invention but a growth out of old ideas both Roman
and barbarian, and next that it was intimately connected in men’s
minds with the thought of land. This was natural, for after all,
land or its products are as necessary to the life of every
individual as air and water, and therefore the cultivation of the
soil and the distribution of its fruits are the first problems with
which governments are faced.</p>

<p>Feudalism assumed that all the land belonging to a nation
belonged in the first place to that nation’s king. Because he
could not govern or cultivate it all himself he would parcel it out
in ‘fiefs’ amongst the chief nobles at his court, promising them
his protection, and asking in return that they should do him
some specified service. This system recalls the ‘villa’ of Roman
days with its senator, granting protection to his tenants from
robbery and excessive taxation, and employing them to plough
and sow, to reap his crops, and build his houses and bridges.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages the service of the chief tenants was nearly
always military: to appear when summoned by the king with so
many horsemen and so many archers fully armed. In order to
provide this force the tenant would be driven in his turn to
grant out parts of his lands to other tenants, who would come
when he called them with horsemen and arms that they had
collected in a similar way. This process was called ‘sub-infeudation’.
Society thus took the form of a pyramid with the king
at the apex, immediately below him his tenants-in-chief, and
below them in graded ranks or layers the other tenants.</p>

<p>This brings us to the base of the pyramid, the people who
could not fight themselves, having neither horses nor weapons,
and who certainly could not lend any other soldiers to their
lord’s banner. Were they to receive no land?</p>

<p>In the Roman ‘villa’ the bottom strata was the slave, the
chattel with no rights even over his own body. Under the
system of feudalism the base of the pyramid was made up of ‘serfs’,
men originally free, with a customary right to the land on which
they lived, who had lost their freedom under feudal law and had
become bound to the land, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ascripti glebae</i>, in such a way that
if the land were sub-let or sold they would pass over to the new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
owner like the trees or the grass. In return for their land,
though they might not serve their master with spear or bow, they
would work in his fields, build his bridges and castles, mend his
roads, and guard his cattle.</p>

<p>From top to bottom of this pyramid of feudal society ran the
binding mortar of ‘tenure’ and ‘service’; but these were not
the only links which kept feudal society together. When
a tenant did ‘homage’ for his land, and ‘with head uncovered, with
belt ungirt, his sword removed’, placed his hands between those
of his lord, and took an oath, after the manner of the thegns
of Wessex to their king, ‘to love what he loved and shun what
he shunned both on sea and on land’, there entered into this
relationship the finer bond of loyalty due from a vassal to his
overlord. It was the descendant of the old Teutonic idea of the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">comitatus</i> described by Tacitus,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> the chief destined to lead and
guide, his bodyguard pledged to follow him to death if necessary.</p>

<p>Put shortly, then, feudalism may be described as a system
of society based upon the holding of land&mdash;a system, that is, in
which a man’s legal status and social rank were in the main
determined by the conditions on which he held (i.e. possessed)
his land. Such a system, to return to our example of the
pyramid, grew not only from the apex, by the sovereign granting
lands, as the King of France did to Rollo ‘the Ganger’, but from
the middle and base as well.</p>

<p>One of the chief feudal powers in mediaeval times was the
Church, for though abbots and bishops were not supposed
to fight themselves, yet they would often have numbers of lay
military tenants to bring to the help of the king or their
overlord. Some of these tenants were men whom they had
provided with estates, but others were landowners who had
voluntarily surrendered their rights over their land in return for
the protection of a local monastery or bishopric, and thus become
its tenants. A large part of the Church land was, however,
held, not by military or lay tenure, but in return for spiritual
services, or free alms as it was called, i.e. prayers for the soul
of the donor. Perhaps a landowner wished to make a pious gift<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
on his death-bed, or had committed a crime and believed that
a surrender of his property to the Church would placate God.
For some such reason, at any rate, he made over his land,
or part of it, to the Church, which in this way accumulated
great estates and endowments, free from the usual liabilities
of lay tenure. All over Europe other men, and even whole
villages and towns, were taking the same steps, seeking
protection direct from the king, or a great lord, or an abbot or
bishop, offering in return rent, services, or tolls on their
merchandise.</p>

<p>Feudalism at its best stood for the protection of the weak in an
age when armies and a police force as we understand the terms
did not exist. Even when the system fell below this standard,
and it often fell badly, there still remained in its appeal to loyalty
an ideal above and beyond the ordinary outlook of the day,
a seed of nobler feeling that with the growth of civilization and
under the influence of the Church blossomed into the flower
of chivalry.</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<span class="i0">I made them lay their hands in mine and swear<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To live sweet lives in purest chastity.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Such are the vows that Tennyson puts in the mouth
of Arthur’s knights, who with Charlemagne and his Paladins
were the heroes of mediaeval romance and dreams. King
Henry the Fowler, who ruled Germany in the early part of the
tenth century, instituted the Order of Knighthood, forming
a bodyguard from the younger brothers and sons of his chief
barons. Before they received the sword-tap on the shoulder
that confirmed their new rank, these candidates for knighthood
took four vows: first to speak the truth, next to serve faithfully
both King and Church, thirdly never to harm a woman, and
lastly never to turn their back on a foe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Probably many of these half-barbarian young swashbucklers
broke their vows freely; but some would remember and obey;
and so amid the general roughness and cruelty of the age, there
would be established a small leaven of gentleness and pity left
to expand its influence through the coming generations. It is
because of this ideal of chivalry, often eclipsed and even
travestied by those who claimed to be its brightest mirrors, but
never quite lost to Europe, that strong nations have been found
ready to defend the rights of the weak, and men have laid down
their lives to avenge the oppression of women and children.</p>

<p>Of the evil side of feudalism much more could be written than
of the good. The system, on its military side, was intended
to provide the king with an army; but if one of his tenants-in-chief
chose to rebel against him, the vassals who held their lands
from this tenant were much more likely to keep faith with the lord
to whom they had paid immediate homage than with their sovereign.
Thus often the only force on which a king could rely were
the vassals of the royal domain.</p>

<p>Again, feudalism, by its policy of making tenants-in-chief
responsible for law and order on their estates, had set up
a number of petty rulers with almost absolute power. Peasants
were tried for their offences in their lord’s court by his bailiff or
agent, and by his will they suffered death or paid their fines.
Except in the case of a Charlemagne, strong enough to send out
<i>Missi</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> and to support them when they overrode local decisions,
the lord’s justice or injustice would seem a real thing to his
tenants and serfs, the king’s law something shadowy and far
away.</p>

<p>As Duke of Normandy, William the Conqueror had been
quite as powerful as his overlord the King of France. When he
came to England he was determined that none of the barons to
whom he had granted estates should ever be his equal in this
way. He therefore summoned all landowning men in England
to a council at Salisbury in 1086, and made them take an oath of
allegiance to himself before all other lords. Because he was
a strong man he kept his barons true to their oath or punished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
them, but during the reign of his grandson Stephen, who disputed
the English throne with his cousin Matilda and therefore tried to
buy the support of the military class by gifts and concessions,
the vices of feudalism ran almost unchecked.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘They had done homage to him and sworn oaths,’ says the
Anglo-Saxon chronicler, ‘but they no faith kept ... for every
rich man built his castles and defended them against him,
and they filled the land with castles.... Then they took these
whom they suspected to have any goods by night and by day,
seizing both men and women, and they put them in prison
for their gold and silver, and tortured them with pains unspeakable....
I cannot and I may not tell of all the wounds and of all
the tortures that they inflicted upon the wretched men of this
land; and this state of things lasted the nineteen years that
Stephen was king and ever grew worse and worse.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Stephen was a weak ruler struggling with a civil war; so that
it might be argued that no system of government could have
worked well under such auspices; but if we turn to the normal
life of the peasant folk on the estates of the monastery of Mont
St. Michael in the thirteenth century, we shall see that the
humble tenants at the base of the feudal pyramid paid dearly
enough for the protection of their overlords.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘In June the peasants must cut and pile the hay and carry it
to the manor-house ... in August they must reap and carry in
the Convent grain, their own grain lies exposed to wind and
rain.... On the Nativity of the Virgin the villein owes the pork
due, one pig in eight ... at Xmas the fowl fine and good ... on
Palm Sunday the sheep due ... at Easter he must plough, sow,
and harrow. When there is building the tenant must bring
stone and serve the masons ... he must also haul the convent
wood for two deniers a day. If he sells his land he owes his
lord a thirteenth of its value, if he marries his daughter outside
the lord’s demense he pays a fine,&mdash;he must grind his grain at
the lord’s mill and bake his bread at the lord’s oven, where the
customary charges never satisfy the servants.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Certainly the peasant of the Middle Ages can have had little
time to lament even his own misery. Perhaps to keep his hovel
from fire and pillage and his family from starvation was all
to which he often aspired.</p>

‘War’, it has been said, ‘was the law of the feudal world’,
and all over Europe the moat-girt castles of powerful barons,
and walled towns and villages sprang up as a witness to
the turbulent state of society during these centuries. To some
natures this atmosphere of violence of course appealed.</p>

<p>So sang a Provençal baron of the twelfth century, and we find
an echo of his spirit in Spain as late as the fifteenth, when
a certain noble, sighing for the joys and spoils of civil war,
remarked, ‘I would there were many kings in Castile for then I
should be one of them.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Truce of God</div>

<p>The Church, endeavouring to cope with the spirit of anarchy,
succeeded in establishing on different occasions a ‘Truce
of God’, somewhat resembling the ‘Sacred Months’ devised by
the Arabs for a like purpose. From Wednesday to Monday,
and during certain seasons of the year, such as Advent or Lent,
war was completely forbidden under ecclesiastical censure, while
at no time were priests, labourers, women, or children to be
molested.</p>

<p>The defect of such reforms lay in the absence of machinery to
enforce them; and feudalism, the system by which in practice
the few lived at the expense of the many, continued to flourish
until foreign adventure, such as the Crusades, absorbed some of
its chief supporters, and civilization and humanity succeeded
in building up new foundations of society to take its place. It
would seem as if the lessons of good government had to be
learned in a hard school, generally through bitter experience on
the part of the governed.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Monasticism</span></h3>

<p>If the study of feudalism is necessary to a knowledge of the
material life of the Middle Ages, its spirit is equally a closed
book without an understanding of monasticism. What induced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
men and women, not just a few devout souls, but thousands
of ordinary people of all nations and classes from the prince to
the serf to forsake the world for the cloister; and, far from
regretting this sacrifice, to maintain with obvious sincerity that
they had chosen the better part? If we would realize the
mediaeval mind we must find an answer to this question.</p>

<p>Turning to the earliest days of monasticism, when the ‘Fathers
of the Church’ sought hermits’ cells, we recall the shrinking
of finer natures from the brutality and lust of pagan society; the
intense conviction that the way to draw nearer God was to shut
out the world; the desire of a Simon Stylites to make the
thoughtless mind by the sight of his self-inflicted penance think
for a moment at any rate of a future Heaven and Hell.</p>

<p>Motives such as these continued to inspire the enthusiastic
Christian throughout the Dark Ages following the fall of Rome;
but, as Europe became outwardly converted to the Catholic
Faith, it was not paganism from which the monk fled, but the
mockery of his own beliefs that he found in the lives of so-called
Christians. The corruption of imperial courts, even those of a
Constantine or Charlemagne, the cunning cruelty of a baptized
Clovis, the ruthless selfishness of a feudal baron or Norman
adventurer fighting in the name of Christ: all these were hard
to reconcile with a gospel of poverty, gentleness, and brotherhood.</p>

<p>Even the light of pure ideals once held aloft by the Church
had begun to burn dim; for men are usually tolerant of evils to
which they are accustomed, and the priest who had grown up
amid barbarian invasions was inclined to look on the coarseness
and violence that they bred as a natural side of life. As a rule
he continued to maintain a slightly higher standard of conduct
than his parishioners, but sometimes he fell to their level or
below.</p>

<p>The great danger to the Church, however, was, as always in
her history, not the hardships that she encountered but the
prosperity. The bishops, ‘overseers’ responsible for the
discipline and well-being of their dioceses, became in the Middle
Ages, by reason of their very power and influence, too often the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
servants of earthly rulers rather than of God. Far better
educated and disciplined than the laymen, experienced in
diocesan affairs, without ties of wife and family, since the Church
law forbade the clergy to marry, they were selected by kings for
responsible office in the state. Usually they proved the wisdom
of his choice through their gifts of administration and loyalty,
but the effect on the Church of adding political to ecclesiastical
power proved disastrous in the end.</p>

<p>Their great landed wealth made the bishops feudal barons,
while bishoprics in their turn came to be regarded as offices at
the disposal of the king; a bad king would parcel them out
amongst his favourites or sell them to the highest bidders,
heedless of their moral character. Thus crept into the Church
the sin of ‘simony’ or ‘traffic in holy things’ so strongly
condemned by the first Apostles, and, following hard on the
heels of simony, the worldliness born of the temptations of
wealth and power. The bishop who was numbered amongst a
feudal baronage and entertained a lax nobility at his palace was
little likely to be shocked at priests convicted of ignorance or
immorality, or to spend his time in trying to reform their habits.</p>

<p>It was, then, not only in horror of the world, but in reproach
of the Church herself that the monk turned to the idea of separation
from man and communion with God. In the earliest days
of monasticism each hermit followed his special theory of prayer
and self-discipline; he would gather round him small communities
of disciples, and these would remain or go away to form
other communities as they chose, a lack of system that often
resulted in unhealthy fanaticism or useless idleness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Benedict</div>

<p>In the sixth century an Italian monk, Benedict of Nursia (480–543),
compiled a set of regulations for his followers, which, under the
name of ‘the rule of Benedict’, became the standard Code of
monastic life for all Western Christendom. Benedict demanded
of his monks a ‘novitiate’ of twelve months during which they
could test their call to a life of continual sacrifice. At the end
of this time, if the novice still continued resolute in his intention
and was approved by the monastic authorities, he was accepted
into the brotherhood by taking the perpetual vows of poverty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
obedience, and chastity, the three conditions of life most hostile
to the lust of possession, turbulence, and sensuality that
dominated the Middle Ages. To these vows were added the
obligation of manual labour&mdash;seven hours work a day in addition
to the recitation of prayers enjoined on the community.</p>

<p>The faithful Benedictine at least could never be accused
of idleness, and to the civilizing influence of the ‘regulars’, as
the monks were called because they obeyed a rule (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">regula</i>), in
contrast to the ‘secular’ priests who lived in the world, Europe
owed an immense debt of gratitude.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is said contemptuously that the monks of the
Middle Ages chose beautiful sites on which to found luxurious
homes. Certainly they selected as a rule the neighbourhood
of rivers and lakes, water being a prime necessity of life, and in
such neighbourhoods raised chapels and monasteries that have
become the architectural wonder of the world. Yet many of
these wonders began in a circle of wooden huts built on a
reclaimed marsh, and it was the labour of the followers of
St. Benedict that replaced wood by stone and swamps by gardens
and farms.</p>

<p>Where the barbarian or feudal anarchist burned and destroyed,
the monk of the Middle Ages brought back the barren soil to
pasturage or tillage; and just as he weeded, sowed, and planted
as part of his obligation to God, so from the produce of his
labours he provided for the destitute at his gate, or in his
cloister schools supplied the ignorant with the rudiments of
knowledge and culture. The monasteries were centres of
mediaeval life, not, like the castles, of death. In his quiet cell
the monk chronicler became an historian; the copyist reproduced
with careful affection decaying manuscripts; the illuminator
made careful pictures of his day; the chemist concocted
strange healing medicines, or in his crucibles developed
wondrous colours.</p>

<p>‘Good is it for us to dwell here, where man lives more purely,
falls more rarely, rises more quickly, treads more cautiously,
rests more securely, is absolved more easily, and rewarded more
plenteously.’ This is the saying of St. Bernard, one of the later<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
monastic reformers; and his ideal was the general conception
of the best life possible as understood in the Middle Ages. To
the monasteries flocked the devout seeking a home of prayer;
but also the student or artist unable to follow his bent in the
turbulent world, and the man who despised or feared the
atmosphere of war. Even the feudal baron would pause in his
quarrels to make some pious gift to abbey or priory, a tribute to
a faith he admired but was too weak to practise. Sometimes he
came in later life, a penitent who, toiling like his serf, sought
in the cloister the salvation of his soul. ‘In the monasteries,’
says a mediaeval German, ‘one saw Counts cooking in the
kitchen and Margraves leading their pigs out to feed.’</p>

<p>Monasticism, with its belief in brotherhood, was a leveller
of class distinctions; but, like the rest of the Church, it found in
the popular enthusiasm it aroused the path of temptation. Men,
we have seen, entered the cloister for other reasons than pure
devotion to God; and the rule of Benedict proving too strict
they yielded secretly to sins that perhaps were not checked or
reproved because abbots in time ceased to be saints and became,
like the bishops, feudal landlords with worldly interests. In
this way vice and laziness were allowed to spread and cling like
bindweed.</p>

<p>Throughout the Middle Ages there were times of corruption
and failure amongst the monastic Orders, followed by waves
of sweeping reform and earnest endeavour, when once again the
Cross was raised as an emblem of sacrifice and drew the more
spiritual of men unto it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foundation of Cluni</div>

<p>In 910 the monastery of Cluni was founded in Burgundy,
and, freed from the jurisdiction of local bishops by being placed
under the direct control of the Pope, was able to establish a
reformed Benedictine Order. Its abbot was recognized not
only as the superior of the monastery at Cluni but also of
‘daughter’ houses that sprang up all over Europe subject to
his discipline and rule.</p>

<p>Other monastic Orders founded shortly after this date were
those of the Carthusians and Cistercians.</p>

<p>In their desire to combat worldliness the early Carthusians,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
or monks of the monastery of Chartreux, carried on unceasing
war against the pleasures of the world. Strict fasting for eight
months in the year; one meal a day eaten in silence and alone;
no conversation with other brethren save at a weekly meeting;
this was the background to a life of toil and prayer.</p>

<p>The monastery of Citeaux in southern France, from which the
Cistercians take their name, was another attempt to live in the
world but not of it. ‘The White Monks’, so called from the
colour of their woollen frocks, sought solitudes in which to build
their houses. Their churches and monasteries remain among
the glories of architecture; but through fear of riches they
refused to place in them crosses of gold and silver or to allow
their priests to wear embroidered vestments. No Cistercian
might recite the service of the Mass for money or be paid for
the cure of souls. With his hands he must work for his meagre
fare, remembering always to give God thanks for the complete
self-renunciation to which he was pledged by his Order.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Bernard of Clairvaux</div>

<p>Chief amongst the Cistercian saints is Bernard (1090–1153), a
Burgundian noble, who in 1115 founded a daughter monastery of
his Order at Clairvaux, and as its head became one of the leaders
of mediaeval thought. When he was only twenty he had appeared
before the Abbot of Citeaux with a band of companions, relations
and friends whom his eloquence had persuaded to enter the
monastery with him. Throughout his life this power over others
and his fearlessness in making use of this influence were his
most vivid characteristics. ‘His speech’, wrote some one who
knew him, ‘was suited to his audience ... to country-folk he
spoke as though born and bred in the country, and so to other
classes as though he had been always occupied with their
business. He adapted himself to all, desiring to gain all for
Christ.’</p>

<p>In these last words lie his mission and the secret of his success.
Never was his eloquence exerted for himself, and so men who
wished to criticize were overborne by his single-minded sincerity.
Severe to his own shortcomings, gentle and humble to his
brethren, ready to accept reproof or to undertake the meanest
task, Bernard was fierce and implacable to the man or the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
conditions that seemed to him to stand in the way of God’s
will.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘I grieve over thee, my son Geoffrey,’ he wrote to a young
monk who had fled the austerities of Clairvaux.... ‘How could
you, who were called by God, follow the Devil, recalling thee?...
Turn back, I say, before the abyss swallows thee ... before
bound hand and foot thou art cast into outer darkness ... shut
in with the darkness of death.’</p></blockquote>

<p>To the ruler of France he sent a letter of reproof ending with
the words: ‘It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the
Living God even for thee, O King!’ and his audacity, instead
of working his ruin, brought the leading clergy and statesmen
of Europe to the cells of Clairvaux as if to some oracle’s temple,
to learn the will of God.</p>

<p>From his cell St. Bernard preached the Second Crusade,
reformed abuses in the Church, deposed an Anti-Pope, and
denounced heretics. In his distrust of human reason, trying to
free itself from some of the dogmatic assertions of early Christian
thought, he represented the narrow outlook of his age: but in
his love of God and through God of humanity he typifies the
spiritual charm that like a thread of gold runs through all the
dross of hardness and treachery in the mediaeval mind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Do not grieve,’ he wrote to the parents of a novice ... ‘he
goes to God but you do not lose him ... rather through him
you gain many sons, for all of us who belong to Clairvaux have
taken him to be a brother and you to be our parents.’</p></blockquote>

<p>To St. Bernard self-renunciation meant self-realization, the
laying down of a life to find it again purified and enriched; and
this was the ideal of monasticism, often misunderstood and
discredited by its weaker followers, like all ideals, but yet the
glory of its saints.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE INVESTITURE QUESTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>We have said that in ‘the Oath of Strasbourg’<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> it was possible
to distinguish the infant nations of France and Germany. This
is true&mdash;yet Germany, though distinct from her neighbours, was
to remain all through the Middle Ages rather an agglomeration
of states than a nation as we understand the word to-day.</p>

<p>One reason for the absence of any common policy and
ambitions was that Charlemagne, though he had conquered the
Saxons and other Germanic tribes, had never succeeded in
welding them into one people. Under his successors the
different races easily slipped back into regarding themselves
rather as Saxons, Franconians, or Bavarians than as Germans:
indeed the Bohemians relapsed into heathendom and became
once more altogether uncivilized.</p>

<p>This instinct for separation was aided by the feudal system,
since rebel tenants-in-chiefs could count on provincial feeling to
support them against the king their overlord. It is hardly
surprising, then, if the struggle that broke out in Germany as elsewhere
in Europe between rulers and their feudal baronage was
decided there in favour of the baronage.</p>

<p>Perhaps if some strong king could have given his undivided
attention to the problem he might have succeeded, like William I
of England, in making himself real master of all Germany; but
unfortunately the rulers of the German kingdom were never free
from foreign wars. Just as the Norsemen had descended on the
coasts of France, so Danes, Slavs, and Hungarians were a
constant menace to the civilization of Germany; hordes of these
barbarians breaking over the frontiers every year, and even
pillaging districts as far west as the Rhine.</p>

<p>German kings, in consequence of this external menace, had to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
rely for the defence of their frontiers upon the military power of
their great vassals. They were even forced to create large
estates called ‘Marks’ (march-lands) upon their northern and
eastern borders to act as national bulwarks. Over these ruled
‘Margraves’ (‘grafs’ or Counts of the Mark) with a large
measure of independence. Modern Prussia was once the Mark
of Brandenburg, a war state created against the Slav; Austria
the Mark placed in the east between Bavaria and the
Hungarians; Schleswig the Mark established to hold back the
Danes.</p>

<p>Yet another cause told for disruption: the fact that when the
Carolingian line came to an end in Germany early in the tenth
century the practice sprang up of electing kings from among the
chief princes and dukes. Though this plan worked well if the
electors made an honest choice, yet it gave the feudal baronage
a weapon, on the other hand, if they wished to strike a bargain
with a would-be ruler or to appoint a weakling whose authority
they could undermine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry ‘the Fowler’</div>

<p>The first of the elected kings of Germany was Conrad of
Franconia, during whose reign the feudal system took strong
root, and who ruled rather through his barons than in
opposition to their wishes. On his death-bed he showed his
honest desire for the welfare of Germany. ‘I know,’ he declared,
‘that no man is worthier to sit on my throne than my
enemy Henry of Saxony.... When I am dead, take him the
crown and the sacred lance, the golden armlet, the sword, and
the purple mantle of the old kings.’ The princes, who followed
his advice, found their new ruler out hawking on the mountain
side, and under the nickname Henry ‘the Fowler’ he became
their king and one of Germany’s national heroes.</p>

<p>In his untiring struggle against invaders Henry I recalls the
Anglo-Saxon Alfred ‘the Great’, and like Alfred he was at first
forced to fly before his enemies. To the disgust of the great
dukes he bought a nine years’ peace from the Hungarians by
paying tribute; but when the enemy went away he at once began
to build castles or ‘burgs’, and filled them with soldiers under
the command of ‘burgraves’. These castles were placed all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
along the frontiers, and gradually villages and towns gathered
round them for safety.</p>

<p>In the tenth year the Hungarians came as usual to ask for the
tribute money, but Henry ordered a dead dog to be thrown at
their messenger’s feet.</p>

<p>‘In future this is all your master will get from us,’ he exclaimed,
and the answer, as he expected, provoked an immediate
invasion. Instead of being able to lay waste the countryside as
of old, however, the Hungarians now found ‘burgs’ well fortified
and provisioned that they could neither take nor leave with safety
in their rear. When at last they met Henry in pitched battle, they
broke and fled before his onslaught, declaring that the golden
banner of St. Michael, carried at the head of his troops, had by
some wizardry contrived their ruin.</p>

<p>Besides repulsing invaders, Henry the Fowler imposed his
will to a considerable extent over his rebellious baronage. In
another chapter<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> we have noticed how he instituted ‘the order of
knighthood’ as a way of harnessing to his service the restless
energy of the younger sons of the nobles: he also tried to
strengthen the middle classes as a counterpoise to the baronage
by encouraging the construction of walled towns for the protection
of merchants, while he would hold his councils rather in
towns than in the woods like his predecessors, in order to attract
people to settle there. Many of the Marks owe their origin to
Henry’s policy of strengthening the border provinces; and in
this and in his determination to subdue the Hungarians he found
an able successor in his son Otto I.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Otto ‘the Great’</div>

<p>Otto’s reign might from one aspect be called a history of wars.
First there were foreign wars&mdash;the subjugation of Denmark,
whose king became a German vassal; the reconquest and conversion
of Bohemia; and also a series of campaigns against the
Hungarians, resulting at last in 955 in a victory at Augsburg
so complete that never again the hated invaders dared to cross
the border save in marauding bands.</p>

<p>But besides fighting against foreign neighbours Otto had a
continual struggle at home in order to reassert the authority of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
the crown over the great duchies such as Lotharingia and
Bavaria. When he was able to do so he would replace the
most turbulent of the dukes by members of his own family, or he
would make gifts of large estates to bishops, hoping in this way
to provide himself with loyal tenants-in-chief. In this, however,
he was not successful, for he found the feudal bishops amongst
his worst enemies; so that he turned at last for help to the new
type of Churchman, bred by the Cluniac reform movement&mdash;men
of learning and culture, monks in their religious
observances, statesmen in their outlook. These were at one
with him in his desire for a united Germany and a purer Church;
but Otto was faced by a great problem when he wished to reform
and control his bishops. How far were the German clergy
under his jurisdiction? How far did they owe obedience only
to Rome, as they claimed if he tried to exert his authority over
them?</p>

<p>Charlemagne had been able to deal easily with such difficulties,
for the Pope had been his ally, almost it might be said his vassal,
and so they could have but one mind on Church matters. By
the time of Otto the Great, however, German kings had long
ceased to be emperors, and the imperial title, bandied about
from one Italian prince to another, had become tarnished in the
world’s eyes. Was it worth while, then, for a German king to
regain this title in order to gain control over the See of St. Peter?</p>

<p>Students of history, able to test mediaeval policy by its ultimate
results, will answer ‘No’, seeing that German kings would
have done well to resist the will-of-the-wisp lure of the crowns of
Lombardy and Rome; but to Otto the question of interference
in Italy bore a very different aspect. Too great to be dazzled
by the title of Emperor, too busy to invade Italy merely for the
sake of forcing the Pope to become his ally, Otto found himself
faced by the necessity of choosing whether he would make himself
lord of the lands on the other side of the Alps or see one of
his most powerful subjects, the Duke of Bavaria, do so instead.</p>

<p>The occasion of this choice was the murder of Count Lothair
of Provence, one of the claimants to the throne of Italy. Lothair’s
widow, Adelaide, a Burgundian princess, appealed to Germany<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
to avenge her wrongs&mdash;a piece of knight-errantry with such
prospects of profit that several of the German princes and notably
the Duke of Bavaria, whose lands lay just to the north of
the Alps, were only too willing to undertake it. In 951 Otto
the Great, anticipating their ambitions, crossed the Alps with an
army, rescued Adelaide from her husband’s murderer, married
her himself, and was crowned King of Italy at Pavia.</p>

<p>Recalled to Germany by foreign invasions, he appeared again
in Italy ten years later, and in February 962 was crowned
Emperor by the Pope at Rome. His successors, dropping the
title ‘King of Germany’, claimed henceforth to be ‘Kings of the
Romans’ on their election and, after their coronation by the Pope,
‘Holy Roman Emperors’&mdash;temporal overlords of Christendom,
as the Popes claimed to be spiritual viceroys.</p>

<p>This coronation of Otto the Great was a turning-point in the
history of Germany, though at the time it caused little stir. To
Otto himself it was merely the culminating success of his career,
enabling him to undertake without interference the reform of
the German Church that he had planned, and also to issue
a charter that, while confirming the Popes in their temporal
possessions, insisted that they should take an oath of allegiance
to the Emperor before their consecration. By this measure the
Papacy became in the eyes of Europe merely the chief see in the
Emperor’s dominions; and under Otto’s immediate successors
this supremacy was not seriously disputed by the Popes themselves.
In some cases they were German nominees, ready to
acknowledge the sceptre that secured their election; but, even
where this was not the case, there was a general feeling that
Rome had less to fear from the tyranny of Emperors beyond
the Alps than from the encroachments of the petty lords of Italy.</p>

<p>The Dukes of Spoletum, Counts of Tuscany, and Barons of
the Roman Campagna had no respect at all for the head of
Christendom except as a pawn in their political moves. One
of the most unscrupulous and dissolute families in the vicinity of
Rome, the Crescentii, who claimed the title of Patrician, once
granted by Eastern Emperors to Italian viceroys, secured the
Papacy for three successive members of their house. Under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
the last of these, Benedict IX, a boy of twelve at the time of his
election, vice and tyranny walked through the streets of Rome
rampant and unashamed. The young Pope, described by
a contemporary as ‘a captain of thieves and brigands’, did not
scruple to crown his sins by selling his holy office in a moment
of danger to another of his family. As his excesses had already
led the people of Rome to set up an Anti-Pope, and as he himself
withdrew his abdication very shortly, the disgraceful state
of affairs culminated in three Popes, each denouncing one
another, and each arming his followers for battle in the streets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Synod of Sutri</div>

<p>The interference of the Emperor Henry III (a member of
the Salian House of Saxony) was welcomed on all sides, and at
the Synod of Sutri the rival Popes were all deposed and
a German bishop, chosen by the Emperor, elected in their place.</p>

<p>Henry III has been described by a modern historian as ‘the
strongest Prince that Europe had seen since Charlemagne’. Not
only did he succeed in subduing the unruly Bohemians and
Hungarians, but he also built Germany into the temporary
semblance of a nation, mastering her baronage and purifying her
Church. His influence over Italy was wholly for her good; but
by the irony of fate his cousin Bruno, whom he nominated to the
See of St. Peter under the name of Leo IX, was destined to lay
the foundations of a Papacy independent of German control.</p>

<p>Bruno himself insisted that he should be elected legally by
the clergy and people of Rome and, though of royal blood, he
entered the city barefoot as a penitent. Unlike the haughty
Roman nobles to whom the title ‘Pope’ had merely seemed an
extra means of obtaining worldly honour and pleasure, he remained
after his consecration gentle and accessible to his
inferiors, and devoted his whole time to the work of reform. At
his first council he strongly condemned the sin of simony, and he
insisted on the celibacy of the clergy as the only way to free them
from worldly distractions and ambitions.</p>

<p>In order that his message might not seem intended for Italy
alone, he made long journeys through Germany and France.
Everywhere he went he preached the purified ideal of the Church
upheld by the monks of Cluni; but side by side with this he and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
his successors set another vision that they strove to realize, the
predominance of the Papacy in Italy as a temporal power.</p>

<p>It was Leo IX who, dreading the Norman settlements in
southern Italy as a menace to the states of the Church, formed
a league against the invaders, but after his defeat at their hands,
followed shortly by his death, his successors, as we have seen,
wisely concluded a peace that left them feudal overlords of Apulia
and Calabria.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Realizing that to dominate the affairs of the
peninsula they must remain at home, future Popes sent ambassadors
called ‘Legates’ to express and explain their will in
foreign countries; while in 1059, in a further effort towards
independence, Pope Nicholas II revolutionized the method of
papal elections. Popes, it was decreed, were no longer to be
chosen by the voice of the people and clergy of Rome generally,
but only by the ‘Cardinals’, that is, the principal bishops of the
city sitting in secret conclave. This body, the College of
Cardinals, was to be free of imperial interference.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pope Gregory VII</div>

<p>Behind Pope Nicholas, in this daring policy of independence,
stood one of the most powerful figures of his age, Hildebrand,
Archdeacon of Rome. The son of a village carpenter, small,
ill formed, insignificant in appearance, he possessed the shrewd,
practical mind and indomitable will of the born ruler of men. It
is said that in boyhood his companions found him tracing with the
chips and shavings of his father’s workshop the words, ‘I shall
reign from sea to sea’, yet he began his career by deliberately
accepting exile with the best of the Popes deposed by the
Council of Sutri; and it was Leo IX, who, hearing of his genius,
found him and brought him back to Rome.</p>

<p>Gradually not only successive Popes but the city itself grew to
lean upon his strength, and when in 1073 the Holy See was left
vacant, a general cry arose from the populace: ‘Hildebrand is
Pope.... It is the will of St. Peter!’</p>

<p>Taking the name of Gregory VII, Hildebrand reluctantly, if
we are to believe his own account, accepted the headship of the
Church. Perhaps, knowing how different was his ideal of the
office from its reality, he momentarily trembled at the task he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
had set himself; but once enthroned there was no weakness in
his manner to the world.</p>

<p>In his ears the words of Christ, ‘Thou art Peter, and on this
rock I will build my Church’, could never be reconciled with
vassalage to any temporal ruler. To St. Peter and his successors,
not to emperors or kings, had been given the power to bind or
loose, and Gregory’s interpretation of this text did not even
admit of two co-equal powers ruling Christendom by their
alliance. ‘Human pride has created the power of kings,’ he
declared, ‘God’s mercy has created the power of bishops ...
the Pope is master of Emperors and is rendered holy by the
merits of his predecessor St. Peter. The Roman Church has
never erred and Holy Scripture proves that it never can err. To
resist it is to resist God.’</p>

<p>Such a point of view, if put to any practical test, was sure to
encounter firm if not violent opposition. Thus, when Gregory
demanded from William of Normandy the oath of fealty alleged
to have been promised by the latter to Alexander II in return for
the Papal blessing upon the conquest of England, the Conqueror
replied by sending rich gifts in token of his gratitude for papal
support, but supplemented them with a message as uncompromising
as the Pope’s ideal: ‘I have not sworn, nor will I
swear fealty, which was never sworn by any of my predecessors
to yours.’ William thereupon proceeded to dispose of benefices
and bishoprics in his new kingdom as he chose, and even went
so far as to forbid the recognition of any new Pope within his
dominions without his leave, or the publication of papal letters
and decrees that had not received his sanction.</p>

<p>Perhaps if England had been nearer to Italy, or if William had
misused his authority instead of reforming the English Church,
Gregory VII might have taken up the gauntlet of defiance thus
thrown at his feet. Instead he remained on friendly terms with
William; and it was in the Empire, not in England, that the
struggle between Church and State began.</p>

<p>The Emperor Henry III, who had summoned the Synod of
Sutri, had been a great ruler, great enough even to have effected
a satisfactory compromise with Hildebrand, but, though before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
he died he succeeded in securing his crown for his son Henry,
a boy of six, he could not bequeath him strength of character or
statesmanship. Thus from his death, in 1056, the fortunes of his
House and Empire slowly waned.</p>

<p>It is difficult to estimate the natural gifts of the new ruler of
Germany, for an unhappy upbringing warped his outlook and
affections. Left at first under the guardianship of his mother,
the Empress Agnes, the young Henry IV was enticed at the age
of eleven on board a ship belonging to Anno, the ambitious
Archbishop of Cologne. While he was still admiring her
wonders the ship set sail up the Rhine, and though the boy
plunged overboard in an effort to escape his kidnappers he was
rescued and brought back. For the next four years he remained
first the pupil of Archbishop Anno, who punished him for the
slightest fault with harsh cruelty and deprived him of all companionship
of his own age, and then of Adalbert, Archbishop of
Bremen, who indulged his every whim and passion.</p>

<p>At length, at the age of fifteen, handsome and kingly in
appearance, but utterly uncontrolled and dissolute in his way of
life, Henry was declared of age to govern for himself, and
straightway began to alienate his barons and people. He had
been married against his wish to the plain daughter of one of his
Margraves, and expressed his indignation by ill-treating and
neglecting her, to the wrath of her powerful relations: he also
built castles on the hill-tops in Saxony, from which his troops
oppressed the countryside: but the sin for which he was destined
to be called to account was his flagrant misuse of his power over
the German Church.</p>

<p>At first, when reproved by the Pope for selling bishoprics and
benefices, Henry was apologetic in his letters; but he had no
real intention of amending his ways and soon began to chafe
openly at Roman criticism and threats. At last acrimonious
disputes came to a head in what is called the ‘Investiture
Question’, and because it is a problem that affected the whole
relations of Church and State in the eleventh century it is
important to understand what it exactly meant to Europe.</p>

<p>Investiture was the ceremony by which a temporal ruler, such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
as a king, transferred to a newly chosen Church official, such
as a bishop, the lands and rights belonging to his office. The
king would present the bishop with a ring and crozier and the
bishop in return would place his hands between those of the
king and do him homage like a lay tenant-in-chief.</p>

<p>The Roman See declared that it was not fitting for hands
sacred to the service of God at His altar to be placed in submission
between those that a temporal ruler had stained with the
blood of war. Behind this figure of speech lay the real reason,
the implication that if the ring and crozier were to be taken as
symbols of lands and offices, bishops would tend to regard these
temporal possessions as the chief things in their lives, and the
oath of homage they gave in exchange as more important than
their vow to do God’s service.</p>

<p>Gregory VII believed that he could not reform the Church
unless he could detach its officials from dependence on lay rulers
who could bribe or intimidate them; and in the age in which he
lived he could show that for every William of Normandy ready
to ‘invest’ good churchmen there were a hundred kings or petty
rulers who only cared about good tenants, that is, landlords who
would supply them faithfully with soldiers and weapons.</p>

<p>As a counter argument temporal rulers maintained that churchmen
who accepted lands and offices were lay tenants in this
respect, whatever Popes might choose to call them. The king who
lost the power of investing his bishops lost control over wealthy
and important subjects, and since he would also lose the right to
refuse investiture he might find his principal bishoprics in the
hands of disloyal rebels or of foreigners about whom he knew
nothing.</p>

<p>The whole question was complicated, largely because there was
so much truth on both sides; Gregory, however, forced the issue,
and early in 1075, in a Synod held at Rome, put forth the famous
decree by which lay investiture was henceforth sternly forbidden.
Henry IV, on the other hand, spoiled his case by his wild disregard
of justice. In the same year he appointed a new archbishop
to the important See of Milan and invested him without
consulting Gregory VII at all; he further proceeded to appoint<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
two unknown foreigners to Italian bishoprics. Angry at the
letter of remonstrance which these acts aroused he called a church
council at Worms in the following year, and there induced the
majority of German bishops very reluctantly to declare Gregory
deposed.</p>

<p>‘Henry, King not by usurpation but by God’s grace, to
Hildebrand, henceforth no Pope but false monk....’ Thus
began his next letter to the Roman pontiff, to which Hildebrand
replied by excommunicating his deposer.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Blessed Peter ... as thy representative I have received from
God the power to bind and loose in Heaven and on earth. For
the honour and security of thy Church, in the name of God
Almighty, I prohibit Henry the King, son of Henry the Emperor,
... from ruling Germany and Italy. I release all Christians
from the oaths of fealty they may have taken to him, and I order
that no one shall obey him.’</p></blockquote>

<p>This decree provided occasion for all German nobles whom
Henry IV had alienated to gather under the banner of the papal
legate, and for the oppressed Saxon countryside to renew the
serious revolt which had broken out two years before. Even
the German bishops grew frightened of the part they had played
in deposing Gregory, so that the once-powerful ruler found himself
looked upon as an outlaw with scarcely a real friend, save the
wife he had ill-treated, and no hope save submission. In the
winter of 1066, as an old story tells, when the mountains were
frozen hard with snow and ice, he and his wife and one attendant
crossed the Alps on sledges, and sought the Pope in his castle
of Canossa, built amidst the highest ridges of the Apennines.</p>

<p>Gregory coldly refused him audience. The King, he intimated,
might declare that he was repentant, he had done so often in the
past, but words were not deeds. Putting aside his royal robes and
clad in a penitent’s woollen tunic, Henry to show his sincerity
remained barefoot for three days like a beggar, in the castle yard.
Then only on the entreaty of some Italian friends was he
admitted to the presence of the Pope, who at his cry of ‘Holy
Father, spare me!’ raised him up and gave him formal
forgiveness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
The scene at Canossa is so dramatic in its display of
Hildebrand’s triumph and the Emperor’s humiliation that it has
lived in the world’s memory: yet it was no closing act in their
struggle, but merely an episode that passed and left little mark.
Henry IV, as soon as he could win himself a following in
Germany and Italy, returned to the practice of lay investiture,
and Gregory VII, who had never believed in his sincerity, continued
to denounce him and plan the coronation of rival
emperors.</p>

<p>Imperial ambitions at last reached their height, for Henry IV
succeeded in inducing German and Italian bishops to depose
Gregory once more and even appoint an Anti-Pope, in whose
name imperial armies ravaged Lombardy, forced their way as far
south as Rome, and besieged Hildebrand in the castle of St.
Angelo. From this predicament he was rescued by the Normans
of South Italy under Robert Guiscard; but these ruthless vassals
of the Church massacred and looted the Holy City directly they
had scaled the walls, and when they turned homewards, carrying
Gregory VII with them, they left half Rome in ruins.</p>

<p>Gregory VII died not long afterwards, homeless and deposed,
but with unshaken confidence in the righteousness of his cause.
‘I have loved justice and hated iniquity,’ he said, during his last
illness, ‘therefore I die in exile.’ ‘In exile thou couldst not
die,’ replied a bishop standing at his bedside. ‘Vicar of Christ
and His Apostles, thou hast received the nations for thine
inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.’
Future history was to show that Hildebrand in defeat had
achieved more than his rival in victory.</p>

<p>Henry IV outlived his enemy by twenty-one years, but they
were bitter with disillusionment. Harassed by Gregory VII’s
successors who continued to advocate papal supremacy, faced by
one rebellion after another in Germany and Italy, Henry IV
yielded at last to weariness and old age, when he found his sons
had become leaders of the forces most hostile to him. Even in
his submission to their demands he found no peace, for he was
thrust into prison, compelled to abdicate, and left to die
miserably of starvation and neglect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
In the reign of his son, Henry V, a compromise on the
‘Investiture Question’ was arranged between Church and
Empire. By the Concordat of Worms it was agreed first that
rulers should renounce their claim to invest bishops and abbots
with the ring and crozier. These were to be given by representatives
of the Church to candidates chosen and approved
by them; but the second point of importance was that this
ceremony must take place in the presence of the king or his representative,
to whom the new bishop or abbot would at once do
homage for his lands and offices.</p>

<p>Almost a similar settlement had been arrived at between
Church and State in England some fifteen years earlier, arising
out of the refusal of Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, to do
homage to Henry I, the Conqueror’s son. In this case there
was no clash of bitterness and dislike, for the old archbishop
was perfectly loyal to the king at heart, though prepared to go to
the stake on a matter of conscience, as this question had become
to earnest churchmen. His master, on his side, respected
Anselm’s saintly character and only wished to safeguard his royal
rights over all his subjects.</p>

<p>Compromise was therefore a matter of rejoicing on both sides,
and with the decisions of the Council at Worms investiture
ceased to be a vital problem. Its importance lies in the fact that
it was one of the first battles between Church and State and,
though a compromise, yet a formal victory for the Church. The
dependence of the Papacy on the imperial government that
Europe had considered natural in the days of Charlemagne, or of
Otto the Great, was a thing of the past, for the acknowledgement
of ecclesiastical freedom from lay supremacy, one of the main
issues for which Hildebrand had struggled, schemed, and died,
had been won by his successors following in his steps.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE EARLY CRUSADES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The imperial standards of Constantinople were designed with
a two-headed eagle typifying Constantine’s rule over the
kingdoms of East and West. Towards the end of the eleventh
century this emblem had become more symbolic of the Emperor’s
anxious outlook upon hostile neighbours. With Asia Minor
practically lost by the establishment of a Mahometan dynasty at
Nicea within one hundred miles of the Christian capital, with
the Bulgarians at the gates of Adrianople, and the Normans and
the Popes in possession of his Greek patrimony in Italy, Alexius
Commenus, when he ascended the throne of the Caesars, found
himself master of an attenuated Empire, consisting mainly
of strips of Grecian seaboard.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of her shorn territories Constantinople remained
the greatest city in Europe, not merely in her magnificent site
and architecture, nor even in her commerce, but in the hold she
preserved over the imagination of men.</p>

<p>Athanaric the Goth had exclaimed that the ruler of Constantinople
must be a god: eleventh-century Europe accepted him as
mortal, but still crowned the lord of so great a city with a halo
of awe. It was Constantinople that had won the Russians,
the Bulgars, and the Slavs from heathenism to Christianity, not
to the Catholicism of Western Europe but the Greek interpretation
of the Christian faith called by its believers the ‘orthodox’.
It was Constantinople whose gold coin, ‘the byzant’, was
recognized as the medium of exchange between merchants of all
nations. It was Constantinople again, her wealth, her palaces,
her glory of pomp and government, that drew Russian, Norse,
and Slav adventurers to serve as mercenaries in the Emperor’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
army, just as auxiliaries had clamoured of old to join the Roman
eagles. Amongst the ‘Varangar’ bodyguard, responsible for
the safety of the Emperor’s person, were to be found at one
time many followers of Harold the Saxon, who, escaping from a
conquered England, gladly entered the service of a new master
to whom the name ‘Norman’ was also anathema.</p>

<p>Alexius Commenus was in character like his Empire&mdash;a shrinkage
from the dimensions of former days. There was nothing of
the practical genius of a Constantine in his unscrupulous ability
to mould small things to his advantage; nothing of the heroic
Charlemagne in his eminently calculating courage. Yet his
daughter, Anna Commena, who wrote a history of his reign,
regarded him as a model of imperial virtues; and his court,
that had ceased to distinguish pomp from greatness and elaborate
ceremonial from glory, echoed this fiction. It was this mixture
of pretension and weakness, of skill and cunning, of nerve and
treachery, so typical of the later Eastern Emperors, that made
the nations of Western Europe, while they admired Byzantium,
yet use the word ‘Byzantine’ as a term of mingled contempt and
dislike.</p>

<p>The Emperor, on his part, had no reason to love his Western
neighbours. The Popes had robbed him of the Exarchate
of Ravenna: they had set up a Headship of the Church in Rome
deaf to the claims of Constantinople. When in the eighth
century the Emperor Leo, the Isaurian,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> earned the nickname of
‘Iconoclast’, or ‘Image-breaker’, by a campaign of destruction
amongst devotional pictures and images that he denounced
as idolatrous, Rome definitely refused to accept this ruling
on behalf of Western Christendom.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the actual schism between the
Eastern and Western Churches that had been always alien
in their outlook. In the ninth century the breach widened,
for Pope Nicholas I supported a Patriarch, or Bishop of
the Eastern Church, deposed by the Emperor and excommunicated
his rival and successor, while subsequent disputes
were rendered irreconcilable in the middle of the eleventh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
century when the Patriarch of Constantinople closed the Latin
churches and convents in his diocese and publicly declared
the views of Rome heretical.</p>

<p>Besides the Pope at Rome the Eastern Empire possessed
other foes in Italy. Chief of these were the Normans, who, not
content with acquiring Naples, had, under the leadership of
Robert Guiscard and his son Bohemund, captured the famous
port of Durazzo on the Adriatic and invaded Macedonia. From
this province they were only evicted by Alexius Commenus after
wearying campaigns of guerrilla warfare to which his military
ability was better suited than to pitched battles or shock tactics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Venetian Republic</div>

<p>More subtly dangerous than either Pope or Normans was the
commercial rivalry of the merchant cities of the Mediterranean,
Pisa, Genoa, and Venice. It was Venice who from behind her
barrier of islands had watched Attila the Hun lead away his
armies in impotent rage.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> It was Venice again who of the
North Italian states successfully resisted the feudal domination
of Western Emperors and kept her own form of republican
government inviolate of external control. It was the young
Venice, the ‘Queen of the Adriatic’ as her sons and daughters
proudly called her, that could alone in her commercial splendour
and arrogance compare with the dying glory of Constantinople.</p>

<p>Alexius Commenus in his struggles against Robert Guiscard
had been compelled to call twice upon Venice for the assistance
of her fleet; but he paid dearly for this alliance in the trading
privileges he was forced to grant in Eastern waters. Wherever
in the Orient Venetian merchants landed to exchange goods
they were quick to establish a political footing; and the world
mart on the Adriatic, into which poured the silks and dyes, the
sugar and spices of Asia, built up under the rule of its ‘Doges’, or
Dukes, a national as well as a commercial reputation.</p>

<p>In 1095 necessity spurred Alexius Commenus to appeal not
merely to Venice for succour but to Pope Urban II and all the
leading princes of Western Europe.</p>

<p>‘From Jerusalem to the Aegean,’ he wrote, ‘the Turkish
hordes have mastered all: their galleys, sweeping the Black Sea<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
and the Mediterranean, threaten the imperial city itself, which,
if fall it must, had better fall into the hands of Latins than of
Pagans.’</p>

<p>These Turks, or ‘Tartars’, to whom he referred, were the
cause of the Eastern Empire’s sudden danger. Descendants of a
Mongol race in central Asia, of which the Huns were also
an offshoot, they turned their faces westward some centuries
later than the ancestors of Attila, fired by the same love of battle
and bloodshed and the same contempt for civilization. To them
the wonderful Arabian kingdom, moulded by successive Caliphs
of Bagdad out of Eastern art, luxury, and mysticism, held no
charm save loot. Conquered Greece had endowed Rome with
its culture, but the inheritance of Haroun al-Raschid bequeathed
to its conquerors only the fighting creed of Islam.</p>

<p>Mahometans in faith, the Turkish armies, more dangerous
than ever because more fanatical, swept over Persia, Syria,
Palestine, and Asia Minor, subjugating Arabs and Christians
until they came almost to the straits of the Bosporus. Here
it was that they forced Alexius Commenus to realize his
imminent danger and to turn to his enemies in Europe for
the protection of his tottering Empire.</p>

<p>The Latins, or Christians of the West, to whom he appealed,
had reasons enough of their own for answering him with ready
promises of men and money. From the early days of the
Church it had been the custom of pious folk, or of sinners
anxious to expiate some crime, to set out in small companies to
visit the Holy Places in Jerusalem where tradition held that
Christ had preached, prayed, and suffered, that there they might
give praise to God and seek His pardon. These ‘pilgrimages’,
with their mixture of good comradeship, danger, and discomfort,
had become very dear to the popular mind, and, if not encouraged
by the Mahometan Arabs, had been at least tolerated.
‘Hospitals’, or sanctuaries, were built for the refreshment of
weary or sick travellers, and pilgrims on the payment of a toll
could wander practically where they chose.</p>

<p>On the advent of the Turks all was changed: the Holy Places
became more and more difficult to visit, Christians were stoned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
and beaten, mulcted of their last pennies in extortionate tolls,
and left to die of hunger or flung into dungeons for ransom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The First Crusade</div>

<p>Tradition says that a certain French hermit called Peter, who
visited Jerusalem during the worst days of Turkish rule, went
one night to the Holy Sepulchre weeping at the horrors he
had seen, and as he knelt in prayer, it seemed to him that
Christ himself stood before him and bade him ‘rouse the Faithful
to the cleansing of the Holy Places’. With this mission in
mind he at once left the Holy Land and sought Pope Urban II,
who had already received the letter of Alexius Commenus and now,
fired by the hermit’s enthusiasm, willingly promised his support.</p>

<p>Whether Urban was persuaded by Peter or no is a matter of
doubt, but he at any rate summoned a council to Clermont in
1095, and there in moving words besought the chivalry of Europe
to set aside its private feuds and either recover the Holy Places
or die before the city where Christ had given his life for the world.
It is likely that he spoke from mixed motives. A true inheritor
of the theories of Gregory VII, he could not but recognize in
the prospect of a religious war, where the armies of Europe
would fight under the papal banner and at the papal will,
the exaltation of the Roman See. Was there not also the hope
of bringing the Greek Church into submission to the Roman as
the outcome of an alliance with the Greek Empire? Might not
many turbulent feudal princes be persuaded to journey to
the East, who by happy chance would return no more to trouble
Europe?</p>

<p>Such calculations could Urban’s ambitions weave, but with
them were entwined unworldly visions that lent him a force and
eloquence that no calculations could have supplied. Wherever
he spoke the surging crowd would rush forward with the shout
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Deus vult</i>, ‘It is the will of God,’ and this became the battle-cry
of the crusaders.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘The whole world,’ says a contemporary, ‘desired to go to the
tomb of our Lord at Jerusalem.... First of all went the
meaner people, then the men of middle rank, and lastly very
many kings, counts, marquesses, and bishops, and, a thing that
never happened before, many women turned their steps in the
same direction.’</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
The order is significant and shows that the appeal of Urban
and of Peter the Hermit had touched first the heart of the
masses to whom the rich man’s temptation to hesitate and think
of the morrow were of no account. Corn had been dear in
France before the Council of Clermont owing to bad harvests;
but the speculators who had bought up the grain to sell at a high
price to those who later must eat or die found it left on their
hands after the council was over. The men and women of
France were selling not buying, regardless of possible famine,
that they might find money to fulfil their burning desire to go
to the Holy Land and there win the Holy Sepulchre and gain
pardon for their sins as Pope and hermit had promised
them.</p>

<p>The ordinary crusading route passed through the Catholic
kingdom of Hungary to Bulgaria and thence to Constantinople,
where the various companies of armed pilgrims had agreed to
meet. It was with the entry into Bulgaria, whose ‘orthodox’<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
king was secretly hostile to the pilgrims, that trouble began.
Food and drink were grudged by the suspicious natives even to
those willing to pay their way; whereupon the utterly undisciplined
forces could not be prevented from retaliating on this
inhospitality by fire and pillage. A species of warfare ensued in
which Latin stragglers were cut off and murdered by mountain
robbers, while the many ‘undesirables’, who had joined the
crusaders more in hope of loot and adventure than of pardon,
brought an evil reputation on their comrades by their greed and
the brutality they exhibited towards the peasants.</p>

<p>Reason enough was here to account for the pathetic failure of
the advance-guard of crusaders, the poor, the fanatic, the disreputable,
drawn together in no settled organization and with no
leaders of military repute.</p>

<p>Alexius Commenus, who had demanded an army, not a rabble,
dealt characteristically with the problem by shipping these first
crusaders in haste and unsupported to Asia Minor. There he
left them to fall a prey to the Turks, disease, and their own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
inadequacy, so that few ever saw the coasts of their native lands
again.</p>

<p>If the First Crusade began in tragedy it ended in triumph,
through the arrival in Constantinople of a second force from the
West, this time of disciplined troops under the chief military
leaders of Europe. Alexius Commenus had good cause to
remember the prowess of his old enemy, Bohemund, son of
Robert Guiscard, who rode at the head of his Sicilian Normans,
while other names of repute were Godfrey de Bouillon, Duke of
Lorraine, and Robert, the eldest son of William the Conqueror,
with Archbishop Odo of Bayeux, his uncle.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Some of the crusaders’, wrote Anna Commena, ‘were guileless
men and women, marching in all simplicity to worship at the
tomb of Christ; but there were others of a more wicked kind, to
wit Bohemund and the like: such men had but one object&mdash;to
obtain possession of the imperial city.’</p></blockquote>

<p>These suspicions, perhaps well founded, were natural to the
daughter of the untrustworthy Alexius Commenus, who trusted
nobody. Hating to entertain at his court so many well-armed
and often insolent strangers, yet fearing in his heart to aid their
advance lest they should set up a rival kingdom to his own, the
Emperor, having cajoled the leaders into promises of homage
for any conquests they might make, at length transported them
and their followers across the Hellespont.</p>

<p>The Christian campaign began with the capture of Nicea in
1097, followed by a victorious progress through Asia Minor.
For nearly a year the crusaders besieged and then were in their
turn besieged in Antioch, enduring tortures of hunger, thirst,
and disease. When courage flagged and hope seemed nearly
dead, it was the supposed discovery, by one of the chaplains, of
the lance that had pierced Christ’s side as he hung upon the
Cross that kept the Christians from surrender. With this
famous relic borne in their midst by the papal legate, the
crusaders flung the gates of Antioch wide and issued forth in
a charge so irresistible in its certainty of victory that the Turks
broke and fled. The defeat became a rout, and Antioch
remained as a Christian principality under Bohemund, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
the crusaders marched southwards along the coast route towards
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>They came in sight of this, the goal of their ambitions, on 7th
June, 1099, not garbed as knights and soldiers but barefooted as
humble pilgrims, kneeling in an ecstasy of awe upon the Mount
of Olives. This mood of prayer passed rapidly into one of fierce
determination, and on 15th June Godfrey de Bouillon and his
Lorrainers forced a breach in the massive walls, and, hacking
their way with sword and spear through the streets, met their
fellow crusaders triumphantly entering from another side. The
scene that followed, while in keeping with mediaeval savagery,
has left a shameful stain upon the Christianity it professed
to represent. Turks, Arabs, and Jews, old men and women,
children and babies, thousands of a defenceless population, were
deliberately butchered as a sacrifice to the Christ who, dying,
preached forgiveness. The crusaders rode their horses up to the
knees in the blood of that human shambles. ‘There might
no prayers nor crying of mercy prevail,’ says an eyewitness.
‘Such a slaughter of pagan folk had never been seen nor heard
of. None knew their number, save God alone.’</p>

<p>Their mission accomplished, the majority of crusaders turned
their faces homewards, but before they went they elected Godfrey
de Bouillon to be the first ruler of the new Latin kingdom
of Jerusalem, with Antioch and Edessa in the north as dependent
principalities.</p>

<p>Godfrey reigned for almost a year, bearing the title ‘Guardian
of the Holy Grave’, since he refused to be crowned master of a
city where Christ had worn a wreath of thorns. His protest is
typical of the genuine humility and love of God that mingled so
strangely in his veins with pride and cruelty. When he
died he left a reputation for courage and justice that wove
around his memory romance and legends like the tales of
Charlemagne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Military Orders</div>

<p>His immediate successors were a brother and nephew, and it
is in the reign of the latter that we first hear mention of the
Military Orders, so famous in the crusading annals of the Middle
Ages. These were the ‘Hospitallers’ or ‘Knights of St. John’,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
inheritors of the rents and property belonging to the old
‘Hospital’ founded for pilgrims in Jerusalem, and the
‘Templars’, so called from their residence near the sight of
Solomon’s Temple.</p>

<p>Both Orders were bound like the monks by the vows of
poverty, obedience, and chastity; but the work demanded of
them, instead of labour in the fields, was perpetual war against
the infidel. ‘When the Templars are summoned to arms,’ said
a thirteenth-century writer, ‘they inquire not of the number but
of the position of their foe. They are lions in war, lambs in the
house: to the enemies of Christ fierce and implacable, but to
Christians kind and gracious.’</p>

<p>Yet a third Order, that of the Teutonic Knights, was founded
in the twelfth century, arising like that of the Knights of St. John
out of a hospital, but one that had been built by German
merchants for crusaders of their own race. At the end of the
thirteenth century the Order removed to the southern Baltic,
and on these cold inhospitable shores embarked on a crusade
against the heathen Lithuanians. It is of interest to students of
modern history to note that in the sixteenth century the last
Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights became converted to the
doctrines of Luther, suppressed his Order, and absorbed the
estates into an hereditary fief, the Duchy of Brandenburg. On
the ‘Mark’<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> and Duchy of Brandenburg, both founded with
entirely military objects, was the future kingdom of Prussia
built.</p>

<p>The Latin kingdom of Jerusalem (1099–1187) survived for more
than three-quarters of a century. That it had been established
with such comparative ease was due not only to the fighting quality
of the crusaders, but also to the feuds that divided Turkish rulers of
the House of Seljuk. The Turks far outnumbered the Christians,
and whenever the Caliphs of Bagdad and Cairo should sink their
rivalries, or one Moslem ruler in the East gain supremacy over
all others, the days of the small Latin kingdom in Palestine
would be numbered. In the meantime the Latins maintained
their position with varying fortune, now with the aid of fresh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
recruits from Europe and Genoese and Venetian sailors, capturing
coast towns, now losing land-outposts there were insufficient
garrisons to protect.</p>

<p>It was the loss of Edessa that roused Europe to its Second
Crusade, this time through the eloquence of St. Bernard of
Clairvaux, who persuaded not only Louis VII of France and his
wife, Queen Eleanor, but also the at first reluctant Emperor
Conrad III, to bind the Cross on their arms and go to the succour
of Christendom. ‘The Christian who slays the unbeliever in
the Holy War is sure of his reward, more sure if he is slain.’</p>

<p>The pictures of the glories of martyrdom and of earthly conquests
painted by the famous monk were so vivid that on one
occasion he was forced to tear up his own robes to provide
sufficient crosses for the eager multitude, but the triumph to
which he called so great a part of the populations of France and
Germany proved the beckoning hand of death and failure.</p>

<p>Both the King and Emperor reached Palestine&mdash;Louis VII
even visited Jerusalem&mdash;but when they sailed homewards they
had accomplished nothing of any lasting value. Edessa remained
under Mahometan rule and the Christians had been forced to
abandon the siege of Damascus that they had intended as a
prelude to a victorious campaign. What was worse was that
Louis and Conrad had left the chivalry of their armies in a track
of whitening bones where they had retreated, victims not merely
of Turkish prowess and numbers but of Christian feuds, Greek
treachery, the failure of food supplies, and disease.</p>

<p>The Byzantine Empire owed to the first crusaders large tracts
of territory recovered from the Turks in Asia Minor; but,
angered by broken promises of homage on the part of Latin
rulers, the Greeks repaid this debt in the Second Crusade by
acting as spies and secret allies of the Mahometans. On
occasions they were even to be found fighting openly side by
side with the Turks, yet more merciless than these pagans in
their brutal refusal to give food and drink to the stragglers of the
Latin armies whom they had so basely betrayed.</p>

<p>The widows and orphans of France and Germany, when their
rulers returned reft both of glory and men-at-arms, reviled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
St. Bernard as a false prophet; but though he responded sternly
that the guilt lay not with God but in the worldliness of those
who had taken the Cross, he was sorely troubled at the shattering
of his own hopes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘The Sons of God’, he wrote wearily, ‘have been overthrown
in the desert, slain with the sword, or destroyed by famine. We
promised good things and behold disorder. The judgements of
the Lord are righteous, but this one is an abyss so deep that I
must call him blessed who is not scandalized therein.’</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Fall of Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem</div>

<p>For some years after the Second Crusade Western Europe
turned a deaf ear to entreaties for help from Palestine, and the
Latin kingdom of Jerusalem continued to decline steadily not
only in territory but in its way of life. The ennervating
climate, the temptations to an unhealthy luxury that forgot
Christian ideals, the almost unavoidable intermarriage of the
races of East and West: all these sapped the vitality and
efficiency of the crusading settlers; while the establishment of
a feudal government at Jerusalem resulted in the usual quarrels
amongst tenants-in-chief and their sub-tenants. In these feuds the
Hospitallers and Templars joined with an avaricious rivalry
unworthy of their creed of self-denial.</p>

<p>By 1183 Guy de Lusignan, who had succeeded in seizing the
crown of Jerusalem by craft on the failure of the royal line,
could only count on the lukewarm support of the majority of
Latin barons. Thus handicapped he found himself suddenly
confronted by a union of the Turks of Egypt and Syria under
Saladin, Caliph of Cairo, a leader so capable and popular that
the downfall of divided enemies was inevitable.</p>

<p>At Hattin, near the Lake of Tiberias, on a rocky, waterless
spot, the Christians and Mahometans met for a decisive battle
in the summer of 1187. The Latins, hemmed in by superior
numbers, and tortured by the heat and thirst, fought desperately
beneath the relic of the True Cross that they had borne with
them as an incitement to their courage; but the odds were too
great, and King Guy himself was forced to surrender when the
defeat of his army had turned into a rout.</p>

<p>In the autumn of the same year Jerusalem, after less than a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
month’s siege, opened her gates to the victor. Very different
was the entry of Saladin to that of the first crusaders; for instead
of a general massacre the Christian population was put to ransom,
the Sultan and his brother as an ‘acceptable alms to Allah’ freeing
hundreds of the poorer classes for whom enough money could
not be provided.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Third Crusade</div>

<p>Europe received the news that the Holy Sepulchre had returned
to the custody of the infidel with a shame and indignation
that was expressed in the Third Crusade. This time, however,
no straggling bands of enthusiasts were encouraged; and though
the expedition was approved by the Pope, neither he nor any
famous churchman, such as Peter the Hermit or St. Bernard of
Clairvaux, were responsible for the majority of volunteers.</p>

<p>The Third Crusade was in character a military campaign of
three great nations: of the Germans under the Emperor
Frederick Barbarossa, or the ‘Red Beard’; of the French under
Philip II; and of the English under Richard the ‘Lion-Heart’.
Other princes famous enough in their lands for wealth and prowess
sailed also; and had there been union in that great host
Saladin might well have trembled for his Empire. He was saved
by the utter lack of cohesion and petty jealousies of his enemies
as well as by his statecraft and military skill.</p>

<p>While English and French rulers still haggled over the terms
of an alliance that would allow them to leave their lands with an
easy mind, Frederick Barbarossa, the last to take the Cross, set
out from Germany, rapidly crossed Hungary and Bulgaria, reduced
the Greek Emperor to hostile inactivity by threats and
military display, and began a victorious campaign through Asia
Minor. Here fate intervened to help the Mahometans, for
while fording a river in Cilicia the Emperor was swept from his
horse by the current and drowned. So passed away Frederick
the ‘Red Beard’, and with him what his strong personality had
made an army. Some of the Teutons returned home, while
those who remained degenerated into a rabble, easy victims for
their enemies’ spears and arrows.</p>

<p>In the meantime Richard of England (1189–99) and Philip of
France had clasped the hand of friendship, and, having levied the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
Saladin Tithe, a tax of one-tenth of the possessions of all their
subjects, in order to pay their expenses, set sail eastwards from
Marseilles. Both were young and eager for military glory;
but the French king could plot and wait to achieve the ultimate
success he desired while in Richard the statesman was wholly
sunk in the soldier of fortune.</p>

<p>To mediaeval chroniclers there was something dazzling in the
Lion-Heart’s physical strength, and in the sheer daring with
which he would force success out of apparently inevitable failure,
or realize some dangerous enterprise.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Though fortune wreaks her spleen on whomsoever she
pleases, yet was he not drowned for all her adverse waves.’</p>

<p>‘The Lord of Ages gave him such generosity of soul and
endued him with such virtues that he seemed rather to belong
to earlier times than these.’</p>

<p>‘To record his deeds would cramp the writer’s finger joints
and stun the hearer’s mind.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Such are a few of the many flattering descriptions the obvious
sincerity of which paints the English king as he seemed to the
men who fought beside him.</p>

<p>A clever strategist, a born leader in battle, fearless himself,
and with a restless energy that inspired him when sick to be
carried on cushions in order to direct the fire of his stone-slingers,
Richard turned his golden qualities of generalship to
dust by his utter lack of diplomacy and tact. Of gifts such as
these, that are one-half of kingship, he was not so much ignorant
as heedless. He ‘willed’ to do things like his great ancestor,
the Conqueror, but his sole weapon was his right hand, not the
subtlety of his brain.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘The King of England had gallows erected outside his camp
to hang thieves and robbers on ... deeming it no matter of what
country the criminals were, he considered every man as his own
and left no wrong unavenged.’</p></blockquote>

<p>This typical high-handed action, no doubt splendid in theory
as a method of discouraging the crimes that had helped to ruin
previous campaigns, was, when put into practice, sufficient alone
to account for the hatred Richard inspired amongst rulers whose
subjects he thus chose to judge and execute at will. The King<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
of France, we are told, ‘winked at the wrongs his men inflicted
and received,’ but he gained friends, while Richard’s progress
was a series of embittered feuds, accepted light-heartedly without
any thought of his own future interests or of those of the
crusade.</p>

<p>Open rupture with Philip II of France was brought about
almost before they had left the French coasts through Richard’s
repudiation of his ally’s sister, to whom he had been bethrothed,
since the English king was now determined on a match with
Berengaria, the daughter of the King of Navarre.</p>

<p>In South Italy he acquired his next enemies in both claimants
then disputing the crown of Sicily, but before he sailed away
he had battered one of the rivals, the Norman, Tancred, into an
outwardly submissive ally after a battle in the streets of Messina.
The other rival, Henry, son of Frederick Barbarossa, and afterwards
the Emperor Henry VI, remained his enemy, storing up
a grudge against him in the hopes of a suitable opportunity for
displaying it.</p>

<p>From Cyprus Richard, pursuing military glory, drove its
Greek ruler because he had dared to imprison some shipwrecked
Englishmen; and thus, adding an island to his dominions and
the Eastern Emperor to his list of foes, arrived at last in
Palestine, in the summer of 1191, just in time to join Philip II
in the siege of Acre.</p>

<p>‘The two kings and peoples did less together than they would
have done separately, and each set but light store by the other.’
So the tale runs in the contemporary chronicle; and when Acre
at last surrendered the feuds between the English and French
had grown so irreconcilable that Philip II, who had fallen sick,
sulkily declared that he had fulfilled his crusading vow and
departed homewards. Not long afterwards went Leopold, Archduke
of Austria, nursing cold rage against Richard in his heart
because of an insult to his banner, that, planted on an earthwork
beside the arms of England, had been contemptuously flung
into the ditch below.</p>

<p>The Lion-Heart was now master of the enterprise in Palestine,
a terror to the Turks, who would use his name to frighten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
their unruly children into submission; but though he remained
fourteen months, the jealousies and rivalries of his camp, with
which he was not the man to contend, kept him dallying on the
coast route to Jerusalem, unable to proceed by open warfare or
to get the better of the wily Saladin in diplomacy.</p>

<p>News came that Philip II and the Emperor Henry VI were
plotting with his brother John for his ruin at home, and Richard,
weary at heart and sick in health, agreed to a three years and
eight months’ truce that left the Christians in the possession of
the seaports of Jaffa and Tyre, with the coastal territory between
them, and gave pilgrims leave to visit Jerusalem untaxed. He
himself refused with tears in his eyes even to gaze from a distant
height on the city he could not conquer; but, vowing he would
return, he set sail for the West in the autumn of 1192, and with
his departure the Third Crusade ended.</p>

<p>There were to be many other crusades, but none that expressed
in the same way as these first three expeditions the united
aspirations of Western Europe for the recovery of the land of the
Holy Sepulchre. National jealousies had ruined the chances of
the Third Crusade, and with every year the spirit of nationality
was to grow in strength and make common action less possible
for Europe.</p>

<p>There is another reason also for the changing character of
the Crusades, namely, the loss of the religious enthusiasm in
which they had their origin. Men and women had believed
that the cross on their arms could turn sinners into saints, break
down battlements, and destroy infidels, as if by miracle. When
they found that human passions flourished as easily in Palestine
as at home and that the way of salvation was, as ever, the path
of hard labour and constant effort, they were disillusioned, and
eager multitudes no longer clamoured to go to the East. The
Crusades did not stop suddenly, but degenerated with a few
exceptions into mere political enterprises, patronized now by
one nation, now by another: the armies recruited by mere love
of adventure, lust of battle, or the desire for plunder.</p>

<p>If Western Christendom had gained no other blessing by
them, the early Crusades at least freed the nations at a critical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
moment from a large proportion of the unruly baronage that
had been a danger to commerce and good government. England
paid heavily in gold for the Third Crusade; but the money
supplied by merchants and towns was well spent in securing
from the Lion-Heart privileges and charters that laid the foundations
of municipal liberty.</p>

<p>In France the results of the Second Crusade had been for the
moment devastating. Whole villages marched away, cities and
castles stood empty, and in some provinces it was said ‘scarce
one man remained to seven women’. In the orgy of selling that
marked this exodus lands and possessions rapidly changed
hands, the smaller fiefs tending to be absorbed by the larger fiefs
and many of these in their turn by the crown. Aided also by
other causes, the King of France with his increased demesnes
and revenues came to assume a predominant position in the
national life.</p>

<p>Perhaps the chief effect of the Crusades on Europe generally
was the stimulus of new influences. Men and women, if they
live in a rut and feed their brains continually on the same ideas,
grow prejudiced. It is good for them to travel and come in
contact with opposite views of life and different manners and
customs, however much it may annoy them at the time. The
Crusades provided this kind of stimulus not only to the commerce
of Mediterranean ports but in the world of thought, literature,
and art. The necessity of transport for large armies improved
shipbuilding; the cunning of Turkish foes the ingenuity of
Christian armourers and engineers; the influence of Byzantine
architecture and mosaics the splendour of Venice in stone and
colour.</p>

<p>Western Europe continued to hate the East; but she could not
live without her silks, spices, and perfumes, nor forget to dream
of the fabulous wonders of Cathay. Thus the age of the
Crusades will be seen at last to merge its failures in the successes
of an age of discovery, that were to lay bare a new West
and another road to the Orient.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE MAKING OF FRANCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Amongst those who took the Cross during the Second Crusade
had been Louis VII of France and his wife, Queen Eleanor.
They were an ill-matched pair, the King of mediocre ability,
weak, peace-loving, and pious; Eleanor, like all the House of
Aquitaine, to which she belonged, imperious, fierce-willed, and
without scruples where she loved or hated. Restless excitement
had prompted her journey to Palestine; and Louis was impelled
by the scandal to which her conduct there gave rise, and also by
his annoyance that they had no son, to divorce her soon after
they returned home.</p>

<p>The foolishness of this step from a political point of view can
be gauged by studying a map of France in the middle of the
twelfth century, and remembering that, though king of the
whole country in name, Louis as feudal overlord could depend
on little but the revenues and forces to be raised from his own
estates. These lay in a small block round Paris, while away to
the north, east, and south were the provinces of tenants-in-chief
three or four times as extensive in area as those of the royal
House of Capet. By marrying Eleanor, Countess of Poitou and
Duchess of Aquitaine, Louis had become direct ruler of the
middle and south-west of France as well as of his own crown
demesnes, but when he divorced his wife he at once forfeited
her possessions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry II of England</div>

<p>Worse from his point of view was to follow; for Eleanor
made immediate use of her freedom to marry Henry, Count of
Anjou, a man fourteen years her junior, but the most important
tenant-in-chief of the King of France and therefore, if
he chose, not unlikely to prove that king’s most dangerous
enemy. This Henry, besides being Count of Anjou, Maine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
and Touraine, was also Duke of Normandy and King of England,
for he was a grandson of Henry I, and had in 1154 succeeded
the feeble Stephen, of the anarchy of whose reign we gave
a slight description in another chapter.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Before dealing with the results of Henry’s marriage with the
heiress of Aquitaine it is well to note his work as King of
England, for this was destined to be the greatest and most lasting
of all the many tasks he undertook. In character Henry was
the exact opposite of Stephen. Where the other had wavered
he pressed forward, utterly determined to be master of his own
land. One by one he besieged the rebel barons, and levelled
with the ground the castles they had built in order to torture
and oppress their neighbours. He also took from them the
crown lands which Stephen had recklessly given away in the
effort to buy popularity and support. When he found that many
of these nobles had usurped the chief offices of state he replaced
them as quickly as he could by men of humble rank and of his
own choosing. In this way he appointed a Londoner, Thomas
Becket, whom he had first created Chancellor, to be Archbishop
of Canterbury; but the impetuous choice proved one of his
few mistakes.</p>

<p>Henry was so self-confident himself that he was apt to underrate
the abilities of those with whom life brought him in contact
and to believe that every other will must necessarily bow to his
own. It is certain that he found it difficult to pause and listen to
reason, for his restless energy was ever spurring him on to fresh
ambitions, and he could not bear to waste time, as he thought,
in listening to criticisms on what he had already decided.
Chroniclers describe how he would fidget impatiently or draw
pictures during Mass, commending the priest who read fastest,
while he would devote odd moments of his day to patching his
old clothes for want of something more interesting to do.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>FRANCE<br />
  in the reign of HENRY II</p></div></div>

<p>Henry II was so able that haste in his case did not mean
that his work was slipshod. He had plenty of foresight, and
did not content himself with destroying those of his subjects
who were unruly. He knew that he must win the support of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
the English people if he hoped to build up his estates in France,
and this, though destined to bear no lasting fruit, was ever his
chief ambition. Henry II was one of the greatest of English
kings, but he had been brought up in France and remained
more of an Angevin than an Englishman at heart.</p>

<p>Instead of driving his barons into sulky isolation Henry
summoned them frequently to his <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Magnum Concilium</i>, or ‘Great
Council’, and asked their advice. When they objected to
serving with their followers in France as often as he wished,
he arranged a compromise that was greatly to his advantage.
This was the institution of ‘Scutage’, or ‘Shield-money’, a tax
paid by the barons in order to escape military service abroad.
With the funds that ‘scutage’ supplied Henry could hire mercenary
troops, while the feudal barons lost a military training-ground.</p>

<p>Besides consulting his ‘Great Council’, destined to develop
into our national parliament, Henry strengthened the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Curia
Regis</i>, or ‘King’s Court’, that his grandfather, Henry I, had
established to deal with questions of justice and finance. The
barons in the time of Stephen had tried to make their own
feudal courts entirely independent of royal authority; but Henry,
besides establishing a central Court of Justice to which any
subject who thought himself wronged might appeal for a new
trial, greatly improved and extended the system of ‘Itinerant
Justices’ whose circuits through the country to hold ‘Pleas of
the Crown’ had been instituted by Henry I.</p>

<p>This interference he found was resented not only by the
feudal courts but also by the Sheriffs of the County Courts,
the Norman form of the old ‘shire-moots’, a popular institution
of Anglo-Saxon times. Of late years the latter courts had more
and more fallen under the domination of neighbouring landowners,
and in order to free them Henry held an ‘Inquest’
into the doings of the Sheriffs, and deposed many of the great
nobles who had usurped these offices, replacing them by men
of lesser rank who would look to him for favour and advice.</p>

<p>Other sovereigns in Europe adopted somewhat similar means
of exalting royal authority; but England was fortunate in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
possessing such popular institutions as the ‘moots’ or ‘meetings’
of the shire and ‘hundred’, through which Henry could establish
his justice, instead of merely through crown officials who
would have no personal interest in local conditions.</p>

<p>By the Assize of Clarendon it was decreed that twelve men
from each hundred and four from each township should decide
in criminal cases who amongst the accused were sufficiently
implicated to be justly sentenced by the royal judges. Local
representatives also were employed on other occasions during
Henry’s reign in assisting his judges in assessing taxes and
in deciding how many weapons and of what sort the ordinary
freeman might fittingly carry to the safety of his neighbours and
of himself. In civil cases, as when the ownership of land or
personal property was in dispute, twelve ‘lawful men’ of the
neighbourhood, or in certain cases twelve Knights of the Shire,
were to be elected to help the Sheriff arrive at a just decision.
In this system of ‘recognition’, as it was called, lay the germ of
our modern jury.</p>

<p>It is probable that the knights and representatives of the
hundreds and townships grumbled continually at the trouble and
expense to which the King’s legislation put them; for neither
they nor Henry II himself would realize that they were
receiving a splendid education in the A B C of self-government
that must be the foundation of any true democracy. Yet a few
generations later, when Henry’s weak grandson and namesake
Henry III misruled England, the Knights of the Shire were
already accepted as men of public experience, and their representatives
summoned to a parliament to defend the liberties
of England.</p>

<p>Henry II used popular institutions and crown officials as
levers against the independence of his baronage, but the chief
struggle of his reign in England was not with the barons so
much as with the Church. Thomas Becket as Chancellor had
been Henry’s right hand in attacking feudal privileges: he had
warned his master that as a leading Churchman his love might
turn to hate, his help to opposition. The King refused to believe
him, thrust the burden of the archbishopric of Canterbury on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
his unwilling shoulders, and then found to his surprise and rage
that he had secured the election of a very Hildebrand, who held
so high a conception of the dignity of the Church that it clashed
with royal demands at every turn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Becket Controversy</div>

<p>One of the chief subjects of dispute was the claim of the
Church to reserve for her jurisdiction all cases that affected
‘clerks’, that is, not only priests, but men employed in the
service of the Church, such as acolytes or choristers. The
King insisted that clerks convicted in ecclesiastical courts of
serious crimes should be handed over to the royal courts for
secular punishment. His argument was that if a clerk had
committed a murder the ecclesiastical judge was not allowed
by Canon law to deliver a death-sentence, and so could do no
more than ‘unfrock’ the guilty man and fine or imprison him.
Thus a clerk could live to commit two murders where a layman
would by command of the royal judges be hung at the first
offence.</p>

<p>Becket, on his side, would not swerve from his opinion that
it was sacrilege for royal officials to lay hands on a priest or
clerk whether ‘criminous’ or not; and when Henry embodied
his suggestions of royal supremacy in a decree called the
Constitutions of Clarendon, the Archbishop publicly refused
to sign his agreement to them. Threats and insults were heaped
upon him by angry courtiers, and one of his attendants, terrified
by the scene, exclaimed, ‘Oh, my master, this is a fearful day!’
‘The Day of Judgement will be yet more fearful,’ answered the
undaunted Becket, and in the face of his fearlessness no one
at the moment dared to lay hands on him.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Becket fled abroad, hoping to win the
support of Rome, but the Pope to whom he appealed did not
wish to quarrel with the King of England, and used his influence
to patch up an agreement that was far too vague to have any
binding strength. Thomas Becket returned to Canterbury, but
exile had not modified his opinions, and he had hardly landed
before he once more appeared in open opposition to Henry’s
wishes, excommunicating those bishops who had dared to act
during his absence without his leave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
The rest of the story is well known&mdash;the ungovernable rage
of the Angevin king at an obstinacy as great as his own, his
rash cry, ‘Is my house so full of fools and dastards that none
will avenge me on this upstart clerk?’ and then his remorse
on learning of the four knights who had taken him at his word
and murdered the Archbishop as he knelt, still undaunted, on
the altar steps of Canterbury Cathedral.</p>

<p>So great was the horror and indignation of Europe, even
of those who were devoted to Henry’s cause, that the King
was driven to strip and scourge himself before the tomb of
Thomas the Martyr, as a public act of penance, and all question
of the supremacy of the state over the Church was for the
time dropped.</p>

<p>One of the many pilgrims who in the next few years visited
the shrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury in the hope of a miracle
was Louis VII of France, and the miracle that he so earnestly
desired was the recovery of his son and heir, Philip Augustus,
from a fever that threatened his life. With many misgivings
the old king crossed the Channel to the land of a ruler with
whom he had been at almost constant war since Eleanor of
Aquitaine’s remarriage; but his faith in the vision of the Martyr
that had prompted his journey was rewarded. Henry received
him with ‘great rejoicing and honour’ after the manner of a
loyal vassal, and when the French king returned home he found
his son convalescent.</p>

<p>The sequel to this journey, however, was the sudden paralysis
and lingering death of Louis himself, and the coronation of the
boy prince in whom France was to find so great a ruler. When
the bells of Paris had rung out the joyous tidings of his birth
one hot August evening fourteen years before, a young British
student had put his head out of his lodging window and demanded
the news. ‘A boy,’ answered the citizens, ‘has been given to
us this night who by God’s grace shall be the hammer of your
king, and who beyond a doubt shall diminish the power and
lands of him and his subjects.’ One-half of the reign of Philip
Augustus, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">le Dieu-donné</i>, or ‘God-given’, was the fulfilment
of this prophecy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
At first sight it would seem as though Henry II of England
entered the lists against his overlord the Champion of France
with overwhelming odds in his favour. Ruler of a territory
stretching from Scotland, his dependency, to the Pyrenees, he
added to his lands and wealth the brain of a statesman and
the experience of long years of war and intrigue. What could
a mere boy, fenced round even in his capital of Paris by turbulent
barons, hope to achieve against such strength?</p>

<p>Yet the weapons of destruction lay ready to his hand, in the
very household of the Angevin ruler himself. Legend records
that the blood of some Demon ancestress ran in the veins of the
Dukes of Aquitaine, endowing them with a ferocity and falseness
strange even to mediaeval minds; and the sons whom Eleanor
bore to her second husband were true to this bad strain if to
nothing else. ‘Dost thou not know’, wrote one of them to his
father who had reproached him for plotting against his authority,
‘that it is our proper nature that none of us should love the
other, but that ever brother should strive with brother and son
against father? I would not that thou shouldst deprive us of
our hereditary right and seek to rob us of our nature.’</p>

<p>Louis VII, in order to weaken Henry II, had encouraged
this spirit of treachery, and even provided a refuge for Becket
during his exile: his policy was continued by Philip Augustus,
who kept open house at Paris for the rebellious family of his
tenant-in-chief whenever misfortune drove them to fly before
their father’s wrath or ambition brought them to hatch some
new conspiracy.</p>

<p>Could Henry have once established the same firm grip he
had obtained in England over his French possessions, he might
have triumphed in the struggle with both sons and overlord;
but in Poitou and Aquitaine he was merely regarded as Eleanor’s
consort, and the people looked to his heirs as rulers, especially
to Richard his mother’s favourite. Yet never had they suffered
a reign of greater licence and oppression than under the reckless
and selfish Lion-Heart.</p>

<p>After much secret plotting and open rebellion, Henry succeeded
in imprisoning Eleanor, who had encouraged her sons to defy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
their father, but with Richard supported by Philip Augustus
and the strength of southern France he was forced to come
to terms towards the end of his reign. Though only fifty-six,
he was already failing in health, and the news that his own
province of Maine was fast falling to his enemies had broken
his courage. Cursing the son who had betrayed him, he sullenly
renewed the oath of homage he owed to Philip, and promised
to Richard the wealth and independence he had demanded.
The compact signed he rode away, heavy with fever, to his
castle of Chinon, and there, indifferent to life, sank into a state
of stupor. News was brought him that his youngest son John,
for whom he had carved out a principality in Ireland, had been
a secret member of the League that had just brought him to
his knees. ‘Is it true,’ he asked, roused for the minute, ‘that
John, my heart ... has deserted me?’ Reading the answer
in the downcast faces of his attendants, he turned his face to the
wall. ‘Now let things go as they will ... I care no more for
myself or the world.’ Thus the old king died.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard I of England</div>

<p>In 1189 Richard the False succeeded his father, and by
his prowess in Palestine became Richard ‘Cœur-de-Lion’.
How he quarrelled with Philip II we have seen in the last
chapter, and that Philip, after the siege of Acre, returned home
in disgust at the other’s overbearing personality.</p>

<p>Philip Augustus does not cut the same heroic figure on the
battle-field as his rival: indeed there was no match in Europe
for the ‘Devil of Aquitaine’, who knew not the word fear, and
the glamour of whose feats of arms has outlasted seven centuries.
It is in kingship that Philip stands pre-eminent in his own
age, ready to do battle at the right moment, but still more ready
to serve France by patient statecraft. While Richard remained
in Palestine, Philip plotted with the ever-treacherous John for
their mutual advantage at the absent king’s expense; but their
enmity remained secret until the joyful news arrived that the
royal crusader had been captured in disguise on his way home
by the very Leopold of Austria whose banner he had once
contemptuously cast into a ditch.</p>

<p>Now the Duke of Austria’s overlord was the Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Henry VI, whose claims to Sicily Richard had often derided;
and the Lion-Heart, passing from the dungeon of the vassal to
that of the overlord, did not escape until his subjects had paid
a huge ransom and he himself had promised to hold England
as a fief of the Empire. ‘Beware, the Devil is loose’, wrote
Philip to John, when he heard that their united efforts to bribe
Henry VI into keeping his prisoner permanently had failed.</p>

<p>The next few years saw a prolonged struggle between the
French armies that had invaded Normandy and the forces of
Richard, who, burning for revenge, proved as terrible a rival to
Philip in the north of France as he had been in the East; and the
duel continued until a poisoned arrow pierced the Lion-Heart’s
shoulder, causing his death. ‘God visited the land of France,’
wrote a chronicler, ‘for King Richard was no more.’</p>

<p>From this moment Philip Augustus began to realize his
most cherished ambitions, slowly at first, but, thanks to the
‘worst of the English kings’, with ever-increasing rapidity.
John, who had succeeded Richard, was neither statesman nor
soldier. To meaningless outbursts of Angevin rage he added
the treachery and cruelty of the House of Aquitaine and a
sluggish disregard of dignity and ordinary decency peculiarly
his own. Soon all his subjects were banded together against
him in fear, hatred, and scorn: the Church, on whose privileges
he trampled; the barons, whose wives and daughters were
unsafe at his court, and whose lands he ravaged and confiscated;
the people, whom his mercenaries tortured and oppressed.
How he quarrelled with the Chapter of Canterbury over its
choice of an archbishop, defied Pope Innocent III, and then,
brought to his knees by an interdict, did homage to the Holy
See for his possessions; these things, and the signing of Magna
Charta, the English Charter of Popular Liberties, at Runymede,
are tales well known in English history.</p>

<p>What is important to emphasize here in a European history
is the contrast of the unpopularity that John had gained for
himself amongst all classes of his own subjects at the very
moment that Philip Augustus seemed, in French eyes, to be
indeed their ‘God-given’ king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">French Conquest of Normandy</div>

<p>While John feasted at Rouen messengers brought word that
Philip was conquering Normandy. ‘Let him alone! Some day
I will win back all he has taken.’ So answered the sluggard,
but when he at last raised his standard it was already too late.
The English barons would have followed ‘Cœur-de-Lion’ on
the road to Paris: they were reluctant to take sword out of
scabbard for John: the very Angevins and Normans were
beginning to realize that they had more in common with their
French conquerors than with any king across the Channel.
Aquitaine, it is true, looked sourly on Philip’s progress, but
the reason was not that she loved England, but that she feared
the domination of Paris, and made it a systematic part of her
policy for years to support the ruler who lived farthest away,
and would therefore be likely to interfere the least in her
internal affairs.</p>

<p>In 1214 John made his most formidable effort, dispatching
an army to Flanders to unite with that of the powerful Flemish
Count Ferrand, one of Philip’s tenants-in-chief, and with the
Emperor Otto IV, in a combined attack on the northern French
frontier. At Bouvines the armies met, Philip Augustus, in
command of his forces, riding with a joyful face ‘no less than
if he had been bidden to a wedding’.</p>

<p>The battle, when it opened, found him wherever the fight was
hottest, wielding his sword, encouraging, rallying, until by
nightfall he remained victor of the field, with the Count of
Flanders and many another of his chief enemies, including the
English commander, prisoners at his mercy.</p>

<p>Philip carried Count Ferrand behind him in chains on his
triumphal march to Paris, while all the churches along the
way rang their bells, and the crowds poured forth to cheer their
king and sing <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Te Deums</i>.</p>

<p>‘The Battle of Bouvines was perhaps the most important
engagement ever fought on French soil.’ So wrote a modern
historian before the war of 1914.</p>

<p>In the days of Louis VII the Kings of France had stood
dwarfed amid Dukes of Normandy and Aquitaine and Counts
of Flanders and Anjou. Now the son of Louis had defeated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
an emperor, thrown one rebellious tenant-in-chief into a dungeon,
and from another, the Angevin John, gained as the reward of
his victory all the long-coveted provinces north of the Loire.
Even the crown treasury, once so poor, was replete for the time
with the revenues of the confiscated Norman and Angevin
estates of English barons, who had been forbidden by their
sovereign to do homage any more to a French overlord.</p>

<p>Philip Augustus had shown himself Philip ‘the Conqueror’;
but he was something far greater&mdash;a king who, like Henry II of
England, could build as well as destroy. During his reign the
menace of the old feudal baronage was swept away, and the
government received its permanent stamp as a servant of
the monarchy.</p>

<p>In his dealing with the French Church Philip followed
the traditions of Pepin the Short and Charlemagne, yet gratifying
as were his numerous gifts to monasteries and convents, they
were dovetailed into a scheme of combining the liberal patron
with the firm master. That good relations between the king and
clergy resulted was largely due to Philip’s policy of replacing
bishops belonging to powerful families by men of humble origin
accustomed to subservience. Also he would usually support the
lesser clergy in their frequent quarrels with their ecclesiastical
superiors, thus weakening the leaders while he won the affection
of the rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Innocent III and France</div>

<p>Like John he came into collision with the iron will of Pope
Innocent III, but on a purely moral question, his refusal to live
with the Danish princess Ingeborg, to whom he had taken
a violent and unaccountable dislike on his wedding-day. The
bride was a girl of eighteen; she could speak no French,
her husband’s bishops were afraid to uphold her cause whatever
their secret opinions, but in appealing to the Pope for help she
gained an unyielding champion.</p>

<p>In other chapters we shall see Innocent III as a politician and
a persecutor of heretics: here he stands as the moral leader
of Europe; and no estimate of his character and work would be
fair that neglected this aspect. It was to Innocent’s political
advantage to please the French king, whose help he needed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
chastise the English John and to support a crusade against an
outburst of heresy in Languedoc. Moreover, he had no armies
to compel a king who accused his wife of witchcraft to recognize
her as queen. Yet Innocent believed that Philip was in the
wrong; and when the French king persuaded his bishops to
divorce him and then promptly married again, papal letters
proceeded to denounce the divorce as a farce and the new
marriage as illegal.</p>

<p>‘Recall your lawful wife,’ wrote Innocent, ‘and then we will
hear all that you can righteously urge. If you do not do this
no power shall move us to right or left until justice be done.’
This letter was followed by threats of excommunication, and
after some months by an interdict that reduced Philip to a
promise of submission in return for a full inquiry into his case.
The promise so grudgingly given remained but a promise, and
it was not until 1213, nearly twenty years since he had so cruelly
repudiated Ingeborg, that, driven by continual papal pressure
and the critical state of his fortunes, Philip openly acknowledged
the Danish princess as his wife and queen.</p>

<p>We have seen something of Philip’s dealings with his greater
tenants-in-chief; but such achievements as the conquest of
Normandy and Anjou and the victory of Bouvines were but the
fruits of years of diplomacy, during which the royal power had
permeated the land, like ether the atmosphere, almost unnoticed.
In lending a sympathetic ear to the complaints of Richard and
his brothers against their father, Philip was merely carrying out
the policy we have noticed in his treatment of the Church.</p>

<p>‘He never began a new campaign without forming alliances
that might support him at each step’, says Philip’s modern
biographer; and these allies were often the sub-tenants of large
feudal estates to whom in the days of peace he had given
his support against the claims of their feudal overlords. Sometimes
he had merely used his influence as a mediator, at others
he had granted privileges to the tenants, or else he had called
the case in dispute before his own royal court for judgement.
By one means or another, at any rate, he had made the lesser
tenants feel that he was their friend, so that when he went out to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
battle they would flock eagerly to his banner, sometimes in
defiance of their overlord.</p>

<p>One danger to the crown lay, not in the actual feudal baronage,
but in the <i>prévôts</i>, officials appointed by the king with power to
exact taxes, administer the laws, and judge offenders in his name
in the provinces. When the monarchy was weak these <i>prévôts</i>,
from lack of control, developed into petty tyrants, and it was
fortunate for Philip that their encroachments were resented
by both nobles and clergy, so that a system of reform that
reduced them again to a subordinate position was everywhere
welcomed.</p>

<p>Gradually a link was established between local administration
and the king’s council, namely, officials called in the north of
France <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">baillis</i>, in the south <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sénéchals</i>, whose duty was to keep
a watch over the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">prévôt</i> and to depose or report him if necessary.
The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">prévôt</i> was still to collect the royal revenues as of
old, but the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bailli</i> would take care that he did not cheat the king,
and would forward the money that he received to the central
government: he would also hold assizes and from time to time
visit Paris, where he would give an account of local conditions
and how he had dealt with them.</p>

<p>In these reforms, as in those of Henry II of England, a process
that was gradually changing the face of Europe can be seen
at work, first the crumbling of feudal machinery too clumsy to keep
pace with the needs and demands of dawning civilization, and
next its replacement by an official class, educated in the
intricacies of finance, justice, and administration, and dependent
not on the baronage but on the monarchy for its inspiration and
success.</p>

<p>The chief nobles of France in early mediaeval times had
regarded such titles as ‘Mayor of the Palace’, ‘Seneschal’,
‘Chamberlain’, ‘Butler’, &amp;c., as bestowing both hereditary
glory and also political power. With the passing of years some
of the titles vanished, while under Philip Augustus and his
grandson Louis IX those that remained passed to ‘new’ men
of humbler rank, who bore them merely while they retained
the office, or else, shorn of any political power, continued as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
honours of the court and ballroom. In effect the royal household,
once a kind of general servant ‘doing a bit of everything
inadequately’ as in the days of Charlemagne, had now developed
into two distinct bodies, each with their separate sphere of work:
the great nobles surrounding their sovereign with the dignity
and ceremonial in which the Middle Ages rejoiced, the trained
officials advising him and carrying out his will.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French Communes</div>

<p>In his attitude to the large towns, except on his own crown
lands where like other landowners he hesitated to encourage
independence, Philip II showed himself sympathetic to the
attempts of citizens to throw off the yoke of neighbouring barons,
bishops, and abbots. Many of the towns had formed ‘communes’,
that is, corporations something like a modern trade union, but
these, though destined to play a large part in French history, were
as yet only in their infancy. They had their origin sometimes
in a revolutionary outburst against oppression, but often in
a real effort on the part of leading townsmen to organize the
civil life on profitable lines by means of ‘guilds’, or associations
of merchants and traders with special privileges and laws.
Some of the privileges at which these city corporations aimed
were the right to collect their own taxes, to hold their own
law-courts for deciding purely local disputes, and to protect
their trade against fraud, tyranny, and competition from outside.
It all sounds natural enough to modern ears, but it awoke
profound indignation in a French writer of the twelfth
century.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘The word “commune”, he says, ‘is new and detestable, for
this is what it implies; that those who owe taxes shall pay the
rent that is due to their lord but once in the year only, and if
they commit a crime against him they shall find pardon when
they have made amends according to a fixed tariff of justice.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Except within his own demesnes Phillip II readily granted
charters confirming the ‘communes’ in their coveted rights,
and he also founded ‘new’ towns under royal protection,
offering there upon certain conditions a refuge to escaped serfs
able to pay the necessary taxes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Achievements of Philip II</div>

<p>In Paris itself his reign marks a new era, when, instead
of a town famed according to a chronicler of the day chiefly for
its pestiferous smells, there were laid the foundations of one of
the most luxurious cities of Europe. The cleansing and paving
of the filthy streets, the building of fortifications, of markets, and
of churches, and above all of that glory of Gothic architecture,
Nôtre Dame de la Victoire, founded to celebrate the triumph
of Bouvines: such were some of the works planned or undertaken
in the capital during this reign. Over the young University
of Paris the King also stretched out a protecting hand,
defending the students from the hostility of the townsfolk by the
command that they should be admitted to the privileges enjoyed
by priests. For this practical sympathy he and his successors
were well repaid in the growth of an educated public opinion
ready to exalt its patron the crown by tongue and pen.</p>

<p>Philip Augustus died in July 1223. Great among the many
great figures of his day, French chroniclers have yet left no
distinct impression of his personality. It would almost seem as
if the will, the foresight, and the patience that have won him
fame in the eyes of posterity, built up a baffling barrier between
his character and those who actually saw him. Men
recognized him as a king to be admired and feared, ‘august’
in his conquests, terrible in his wrath if any dared cross his will,
but his reserve, his indifference to court gaiety, his rigid attitude
of dislike to those who used oaths or blasphemy, they found wholly
unsympathetic and strange. Of the great work he had done for
France they were too close to judge fairly, and would have understood
him better had he been rash and heedless of design like the
Lion-Heart. For a real appreciation of Philip Augustus we must
turn to his modern biographer.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘He had found France a small realm hedged in by mighty
rivals. When he began his reign but a very small portion of
the French-speaking people owned his sway. As suzerain his
power was derided. Even as immediate lord he was defied and
set at nought. But when he died the whole face of France was
changed. The King of the Franks was undisputedly the king
of by far the greater part of the land, and the internal strength<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
of his government had advanced as rapidly and as securely as
the external power.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was the change in France itself, but we can estimate
also to-day, what no contemporary of Philip Augustus could
have realized, the effect of that change on Europe, when France
from a collection of feudal fiefs stood forth at last a nation in
the modern sense, ready to take her place as a leader amongst
her more backward neighbours.</p>

<span class="subhead">EMPIRE AND PAPACY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When the Emperor Henry IV crossed the ice-bound Alps
on his journey of submission to Canossa he was accompanied
by a faithful knight, Frederick of Buren, whom he later rewarded
for his loyalty with the hand of his daughter and the title Duke
of Suabia. Frederick’s son was elected Emperor as Conrad III,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
the first of the imperial line of Hohenstaufen that was destined
to carry on through several generations the war between Empire
and Papacy.</p>

<p>The Hohenstaufen received their name from a hill on which
stood one of Frederick of Buren’s strongest castles, but they
were also called ‘Waiblingen’ after a town in their possession;
while the House of Bavaria, their chief rivals, was called ‘Welf’
after an early ancestor. The feud of the Waiblingen and the
Welfs that convulsed Germany had no less devastating an effect
upon Italy, always exposed to influence from beyond the Alps,
and the names of the rivals, corrupted on Italian tongues into
‘Ghibellines’ and ‘Guelfs’, became party cries throughout the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Italian Communes</div>

<p>In our last chapter we spoke of French ‘communes’, municipalities
that rebelled against their overlords, setting up a
government of their own: the same process of emancipation was
at work in North Italy only that it was able to act with greater
rapidity and success for a time on account of the national tendency
towards separation and the vigour of town life.</p>

<p>‘In France’, says a thirteenth-century Italian, in surprise,
‘only the townspeople dwell in towns: the knights and noble
ladies stay ... on their own demesnes.’ Certainly the contrast
with his native Lombardy was strong. There each city lived
like a fortified kingdom on its hill-top, or in the midst of wide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
plains, cut off from its neighbours by suspicion, by jealousy, by
competition. In the narrow streets noble and knight jostled
shoulders perforce with merchants, students, mountebanks, and
beggars. The limits of space dictated that many things in life
must be shared in common, whether religious processions or
plagues, and if street fighting flourished in consequence so also
did class intimacy and a sharpening of wits as well as of swords.
Thus the towns of North Italy, like flowers in a hot-house, bore
fruits of civilization in advance of the world outside, whether in
commerce, painting, or the art of self-government; and visitors
from beyond the Alps stared astonished at merchants’ luxurious
palaces that made the castles of their own princes seem mere
barbarian strongholds.</p>

<p>Yet this profitable independence was not won without struggles
so fierce and continuous that they finally endangered the political
freedom in whose interests they had originally been waged. At
first the struggle was with barbarian invaders; and here, as in
the case of Rome and the Popes, it was often the local bishops
who, when emperors at Constantinople ceased to govern except
in name, fostered the young life of the city states and educated
their citizens in a rough knowledge of war and statecraft.</p>

<p>With the dawn of feudalism bishops degenerated into tyrants,
and municipalities began to elect consuls and advisory councils
and under their leadership to rebel against their former benefactors,
and to establish governments independent of their
control.</p>

<p>The next danger was from within: cities are swayed more
easily than nations, and too often the ‘communes’ of Lombardy
became the prey of private factions or of more powerful city
neighbours. Class warred against class and city against city;
and out of their struggles arose leagues and counter-leagues,
bewildering to follow like the ever-changing colours of a kaleidoscope.</p>

<p>Into this atmosphere of turmoil the quarrel between Popes and
Holy Roman Emperors, begun by Henry IV and Hildebrand
and carried on by the Hohenstaufen and the inheritors of
Hildebrand’s ideals, entered from the ‘communes’ point of view<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
like a heaven-sent opportunity for establishing their independence.
In the words of a tenth-century bishop: ‘The Italians always
wish to have two masters that they may keep one in check by the
other.’</p>

<p>The cities that followed the Hohenstaufen were labelled
‘Ghibelline’, those that upheld the Pope ‘Guelf’; and at first,
and indeed throughout the contest where cruelty and treachery
were concerned, there was little to choose between the rivals.
Later, however, the fierce imperialism of Frederick I was to give
to the warfare of his opponents, the Guelfs, a patriotic aspect.</p>

<p>Frederick I, the ‘Barbarossa’ of the Third Crusade, was
a Hohenstaufen on his father’s side, a Welf on his mother’s;
and it had been the hope of those who elected him Emperor
that ‘like a corner-stone he would bind the two together ... that
thus with God’s blessing he might end their ancient quarrel’.
At first it appeared this hope might be realized, for the new
Emperor made a friend of his cousin Henry the Lion who, as
Duke of Bavaria and Saxony, was heir of the Welf ambitions.
Frederick also, by his firm and business-like rule, established
what the chroniclers called such ‘unwonted peace’ that ‘men
seemed changed, the world a different one, the very Heaven
milder and softer’.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Frederick, who has been aptly described as an
‘imperialist Hildebrand’, regarded the peace of Germany merely
as a stepping-stone to wider ambitions. Justinian, who had ruled
Europe from Constantinople, was his model, and with the help
of lawyers from the University of Bologna, whom he handsomely
rewarded for their services, he revived all the old imperial claims
over North Italy that men had forgotten or allowed to slip into
disuse. The ‘communes’ found that rights and privileges for
which their ancestors had fought and died were trampled under
foot by an imperial official, the <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">podestà</i>, sent as supreme governor
to each of the more important towns: taxes were imposed and
exacted to the uttermost coin by his iron hand: complaint or
rebellion were punished by torture and death.</p>

<p>‘Death for freedom is the next best thing to freedom,’ cried
the men of Crema, flaming into wild revolt, while Milan shut her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
gates against her <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">podestà</i> in an obstinate three years’ siege.
Deliverance was not yet, and Frederick and his vast army
of Germans desolated the plains: Crema was burned, her
starving population turned adrift: the glory of Milan was reduced
to a stone quarry: Pope Alexander III who, feeling his own
independence threatened by imperial demands, had supported the
movement for liberty, was driven from Rome and forced to seek
refuge in France. Everywhere the Ghibellines triumphed, and
it was in these black days in Italy that the Guelfs ceased for
a time to be a faction and became patriots, while the Pope stood
before the world the would-be saviour of his land from a foreign
yoke.</p>

<p>Amid the smouldering ruins of Milan the Lombard League
sprang into life: town after town, weary of German oppression
and insolence, offered their allegiance: even Venice, usually
selfish in the safe isolation of her lagoons, proffered ships and
money. Milan was rebuilt, and a new city, called after the
patriot Pope ‘Alessandria’, was founded on a strategic site.
<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Alessandria degla paglia</i>, ‘Alessandria of the straw’, Barbarossa
nicknamed it contemptuously, threatening to burn it like a heap
of weeds; but the new walls withstood his best engines, and
plague and the damp cold of winter devastated his armies
encamped around them.</p>

<p>The political horizon was not, indeed, so fair for the Emperor
as in the early days of his reign. Germany seethed with plots
in her master’s absence, and Frederick had good reason to
suspect that Henry the Lion was their chief author, the more
that he had sulkily refused to share in this last Italian campaign.
Worst of all was the news that Alexander III, having negotiated
alliances with the Kings of France and England, had returned
to Italy and was busy stirring up any possible seeds of revolt
against Frederick, whom he had excommunicated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Legnano</div>

<p>In the year 1176, at Legnano, fifteen miles from Milan, the
armies of the League and Empire met in decisive battle,
Barbarossa nothing doubting of his success against mere armed
citizens; but the spirit of the men of Crema survived in the
‘Company of Death’, a bodyguard of Milanese knights sworn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
to protect their <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">carroccio</i>, or sacred cart, or else to fall beside
it. Upon the <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">carroccio</i> was raised a figure of Christ with arms
outstretched, beneath his feet an altar, while from a lofty pole
hung the banner of St. Ambrose, patron saint of Milan.</p>

<p>When the battle opened the first terrific onslaught of German
cavalry broke the Milanese lines; but the Company of Death,
reckless in their resolve, rallied the waverers and turned defence
into attack. In the ensuing struggle the Emperor was unhorsed,
and, as the rumour spread through the ranks that he had been
killed, the Germans broke, and their retreat became a wild,
unreasoning rout that bore their commander back on its tide,
unable to stem the current, scarcely able to save himself.</p>

<p>Such was the battle of Legnano, worthy to be remembered
not as an isolated twelfth-century victory of one set of forces
against another, but as one of the first very definite advances in
the great campaign for liberty that is still the battle of the world.
At Venice in the following year the Hohenstaufen acknowledged
his defeat and was reconciled to the Church; while by the
‘Perpetual Peace of Constance’ signed in 1183 he granted to the
communes of North Italy ‘all the royal rights (regalia) which
they had ever had or at the moment enjoyed’.</p>

<p>Such rights&mdash;coinage, the election of officials and judges, the
power to raise and control armies, to impose and exact taxes&mdash;are
the pillars on which democracy must support her house
of freedom. Yet since ‘freedom’ to the mediaeval mind too
often implied the right to oppress some one else or maintain
a state of anarchy, too much stress must not be laid on the
immediate gains. North Italy in the coming centuries was to
fall again under foreign rule, her ‘communes’ to abuse and
betray the rights for which the Company of Death had risked
their lives: yet, in spite of this taint of ignorance and treachery,
the victory of Legnano had won for Europe something infinitely
precious, the knowledge that tyrants could be overthrown by the
popular will and feudal armies discomfited by citizen levies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry ‘the Lion’</div>

<p>Barbarossa returned to Germany to vent his rage on Henry
the Lion, to whose refusal to accompany him to Italy he considered
his defeat largely due. Strong in the support of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Church, to which he was now reconciled, he summoned his cousin
to appear before an imperial Diet and make answer to the charge
of having confiscated ecclesiastical lands and revenues for his
own use. Henry merely replied to this mandate by setting fire
to Church property in Saxony, and in his absence the ban of
outlawry was passed against him by the Diet. Here again was
the old ‘Waiblingen’ and ‘Welf’ feud bursting into flame, like
a fire that has been but half-suppressed, and cousinship went to
the wall. Henry the Welf was a son-in-law of Henry II of England
and had made allies of Philip Augustus and the King of Denmark:
his Duchy of Bavaria in the south and of Saxony in the north
covered a third of German territory: he had been winning
military laurels in a struggle against the Slavs, while Frederick
had been losing Lombardy. Thus he pitted himself against the
Emperor, unmindful that even in Germany the hands of the
political clock were moving forward and feudalism slowly giving
up its dominion.</p>

<p>To the dawning sense of German nationality Barbarossa was
something more than first among his barons, he was a king
supported by the Church, and Bavarians and Saxons came
reluctantly to the rebel banner; while, as the campaign developed,
the other princes saw their fellow vassal beaten and despoiled
of his lands and driven into exile without raising a finger to
help him.</p>

<p>Frederick allowed Henry the Lion to keep his Brunswick
estates, but Saxony and Bavaria he divided up amongst minor
vassals, in order to avoid the risk of another powerful rival.
Master of Germany not merely in name but in power, he and
his successors could have built up a strong monarchy, as Philip
II and the House of Capet were to do in France, had not the
siren voice of Italy called them to wreck on her shifting policies.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have spoken chiefly of North Italy; but Frederick I
bound Germany to her southern neighbours by fresh ties when
he married his eldest son Henry in 1187 to Constance, heiress
of the Norman kingdom of Naples and Sicily. By this alliance
he hoped to establish a permanent Hohenstaufen counterpoise
in the south to the alliance of the Pope and the Guelf towns in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
the north. Triumphant over the wrathful but helpless Roman
See, he felt himself an emperor indeed, and having crowned his
son Henry as ‘Caesar’, in imitation of classic times, he rode away
to the Third Crusade, still lusting after adventure and glory.</p>

<p>The news of his death in Asia Minor<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> swept Germany with
sadness and pride. Like all his house, he had been cruel and
hard; but vices like these seemed to weigh little to the mediaeval
mind against the peace and prosperity enjoyed under his rule.
Legends grew about his name, and the peasants whispered that
he had not died but slept beneath the sandstone rocks, and would
awake again when his people were in danger to be their leader
and protector.</p>

<p>Henry VI, who succeeded Frederick in the Empire, succeeded
also to his dreams and the pitfalls that they inspired. One of
his earliest struggles had been the finally successful attempt to
secure Sicily against the claims of Count Tancred, an illegitimate
grandson of the last ruler. Great were the sufferings of the
unhappy Sicilians who had adopted the Norman’s cause; for
Henry, having bribed or coerced the Pope and North Italy into
a temporary alliance, exacted a bitter vengeance. Tancred’s
youthful son, blinded and mutilated, was sent with his mother to
an Alpine prison to end his days, while in the dungeons of
Palermo and Apulia torture and starvation brought to his
followers death as a blessed relief from pain.</p>

<p>Queen Constance, who had been powerless to check these
atrocities, turned against her husband in loathing: the Pope
excommunicated their author; but Henry VI laughed contemptuously
at both. It was his threefold ambition: first, to make the
imperial crown not elective but hereditary in the House of
Hohenstaufen; next, to tempt the German princes into accepting
this proposition by the incorporation of Naples and Sicily as
a province of the Empire; and thirdly, to rule all his dominions
from his southern kingdom, with the Pope at Rome, as in the days
of Otto the Great, the chief bishop in his empire.</p>

<p>Strong-willed, persistent, resourceful, with the imagination
that sees visions, and the practical brain of a man of business who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
can realize them, Henry VI, had he lived longer, might have
gained at least a temporary recognition of his schemes; but in
1197 he died at the age of thirty-two, leaving a son not yet three
years old as the heir of Hohenstaufen ambitions. Twelve months
later died also Queen Constance, having reversed as much as
she could during her short widowhood of her hated husband’s
German policy, and having bequeathed the little King of
Naples to the guardianship of the greatest of mediaeval Popes
and the champion of the Guelfs, Innocent III.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pope Innocent III</div>

<p>At the coronation of Innocent III the officiating priest had
used these words: ‘Take the tiara and know that thou art the
father of princes and kings, the ruler of the world, the Vicar on
earth of our Saviour Jesus Christ.’ To Lothario di Conti this
utterance was but the confirmation of his own beliefs, as unshakable
as those of Hildebrand, as wide in their scope as the
imperialism of Frederick Barbarossa or Henry VI. ‘The Lord
Jesus Christ,’ he declared, ‘has set up one ruler over all things
as His Universal Vicar, and as all things in Heaven, Earth, and
Hell bow the knee to Christ, so should all obey Christ’s Vicar
that there be one flock and one shepherd.’ Again: ‘Princes
have power on earth, priests have also power in Heaven.’</p>

<p>In illustration of these views he likened the Papacy to the sun,
the Empire to the lesser light of the moon, and recalled how
Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane gave to St. Peter two swords.
By these, he explained, were meant temporal and spiritual power,
and emperors who claimed to exercise the former could only do
so by the gracious consent of St. Peter’s successors, since ‘the
Lord gave Peter the rule not only of the universal Church but
also the rule of the whole world’.</p>

<p>Gregory VII had made men wonder in the triumph of Canossa
whether such an ideal of the Papacy could ever be realized; but
as if in proof he had been hunted from Rome and died in exile.
It was left to Innocent III to exhibit the partial fulfilment, at any
rate, of all that his predecessor had dreamed. In character no
saintly Bernard of Clairvaux, but a clear-brained practical statesman,
he set before himself the vision of a kingdom of God on
earth after the pattern of earthly kingdoms; and to this end, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
he sincerely believed carried with it the blessing of God for the
perfecting of mankind, he used every weapon in his armoury.</p>

<p>Sometimes his ambitions failed, as when, in a real glow of
enthusiasm, he preached the Fourth Crusade&mdash;an expedition that
ended in Venice, who had promised the necessary ships, diverting
the crusaders to storm her a coveted port on the Dalmatian
coast, and afterwards to sack and burn Constantinople in the
mingled interests of commerce and pillage. His anger at the
news that the remonstrances of his legates had been ignored
could hardly at first be extinguished. Not thus had been his
plan of winning Eastern Christendom to the Catholic Faith and
of destroying the infidel; for the Latin Empire of Constantinople,
set up by the victorious crusaders, was obviously too weak to
maintain for long its tyranny over hostile Greeks, or to serve as
an effective barrier against the Turks. Statesmanship, however,
prompted him to reap what immediate harvest he could
from the blunders of his faithless sons; and he accepted the
submission of the Church in Constantinople as a debt long owing
to the Holy See.</p>

<p>The Fourth Crusade, in spite of the extension of Rome’s
ecclesiastical influence, must be reckoned as one of Innocent’s
failures. In the West, on the other hand, the atmosphere
created by his personality and statecraft made the name of ‘The
Lord Innocent’ one of weight and fear to his enemies, of rejoicing
to his friends. When upholding Queen Ingeborg he had stood as
a moral force, bending Philip Augustus to his will by his convinced
determination; and this same tenacity of belief and purpose,
added to the purity of his personal life and the charm of his
manner, won him the affection of the Roman populace, usually so
hostile to its Vicars.</p>

<p>Mediaeval popes were, as a rule, respected less in Italy than
beyond the Alps, and least of all in their own capital, where too
many spiritual gifts had been seen debased for material ends, and
papal acts were often at variance with pious professions. During
the pontificate of Innocent III, however, we find the ‘Prefect’,
the imperial representative at Rome, accept investiture at his
hands, the ‘Senator’, chief magistrate of the municipality, do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
him homage; and through this double influence his control
became paramount over the city government.</p>

<p>In Naples and Sicily he was able to continue the policy of
Constance, drive out rebellious German barons, struggle against
the Saracens in Sicily, and develop the education of his ward,
the young King of Naples, as the spiritual son who should one
day do battle for his ideals. ‘God has not spared the rod,’ he
wrote to Frederick II. ‘He has taken away your father and
mother: yet he has given you a worthier father, His Vicar; and
a better mother, the Church.’</p>

<p>In Lombardy, where the Guelfs naturally turned to him as
their champion, the papal way was comparatively smooth, for
the cruelty of Barbarossa and his son Henry VI had aroused
hatred and suspicion on all sides. Thus Innocent found himself
more nearly the master of Italy than any Pope before his
time, and from Italy his patronage and alliances extended like
a web all over Europe.</p>

<p>Philip Augustus of France, trying to ignore and defy him,
found in the end the anger he aroused worth placating: John of
England changed his petulant defiance into submission and an
oath of homage: Portugal accepted him as her suzerain: rival
kings of Hungary sought his arbitration: even distant Armenia
sent ambassadors to ask his protection. His most impressive
triumph, however, was secured in his dealings with the Empire.</p>

<p>Henry VI had wished, we have seen, to make the imperial
crown hereditary; but no German prince would have been
willing to accept the child he left as heir to his troubled fortunes.
The choice of the electors therefore wavered between another
Hohenstaufen, Philip of Suabia, brother of the late Emperor, and
the Welf Otto, son of Henry the Lion. The votes were divided,
and each claimant afterwards declared himself the legally elected
emperor, one with the title Philip II, the other with that of
Otto IV.</p>

<p>For ten long years Germany was devastated by their civil
wars. Otto, as the Guelf representative, gained the support of
Innocent the Great, to whom the claimants at one time appealed
for arbitration; but Philip refused to submit to this judgement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
in favour of his rival, believing that he himself had behind him
the majority of the German princes and of the official class.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Inasmuch,’ declared Innocent, ‘as our dearest son in Christ,
Otto, is industrious, prudent, discreet, strong and constant, himself
devoted to the Church ... we by the authority of St. Peter
receive him as King and will in due course bestow on him the
imperial crown.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Here was papal triumph! Rome no longer patronized but
patron, with Otto on his knees, gratefully promising submission
and homage with every kind of ecclesiastical privilege, to
complete the picture. Yet circumstances change traditions as
well as people, and when the death of Philip of Suabia left him
master of Germany, the Guelf Otto found his old ideals impracticable:
he became a Ghibelline in policy, announced his
imperial rights over Lombardy, even over some of the towns
belonging to the Pope, while he loudly announced his intention
of driving the young Hohenstaufen from Naples.</p>

<p>Innocent’s wrath at this <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">volte-face</i> was unbounded. Otto, no
longer his ‘dearest son in Christ’, was now a perjurer and
schismatic, whose excommunication and deposition were the
immediate duty of Rome. Neither, however, was likely to be
effective unless the Pope could provide Italy and Germany with
a rival, whose dazzling claims, backed by papal support, would
win him followers wherever he went. In this crisis Innocent
found his champion in the Hohenstaufen prince denounced by
Otto, a lad educated almost since infancy in the tenets and
ambitions of the Catholic Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Frederick II</div>

<p>Frederick, King of Naples and Sicily, was an interesting
development of hereditary tastes and the atmosphere in which
he had been reared. To the southern blood that leaped in his
veins he owed perhaps his hot passions, his sensuous appreciation
of luxury and art, his almost Saracen contempt for women
save as toys to amuse his leisure hours. From the Hohenstaufen
he imbibed strength, ambition, and cruelty, from the
Norman strain on his mother’s side his reckless daring and
treachery. With the ordinary education of a prince of his day,
Frederick’s qualities and vices might have merely produced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
a warrior king of rather exceptional ability; but thanks to the
papal tutors provided by Innocent, the boy’s naturally quick brain
and imagination were stirred by a course of studies far superior
to what his lay contemporaries usually enjoyed, and he emerged
in manhood with a real love of books and culture, and with an
eager curiosity on such subjects as philosophy and natural
history.</p>

<p>In the royal charter by which he founded the University of
Naples Frederick expressed his intention that here ‘those
within the Kingdom who had hunger for knowledge might find
the food for which they were yearning’; and his court at
Palermo, if from one aspect dissolute and luxurious, was also
a centre for men of wit and knowledge against whose brains the
King loved to test his own quips and theories.</p>

<p>When Frederick reached Rome, on Innocent’s hasty summons
to unsheath the sword of the Hohenstaufen against Otto, much
of his character was as yet a closed book even to himself.
Impulsive and eager, like any ambitious youth of seventeen
called to high adventure, and with a genuine respect for his
guardian, he did not look far ahead; but kneeling at the Pope’s
feet, pledged his homage and faith before he rode away northwards
to win an empire. In Germany a considerable following
awaited him, lifelong opponents of Otto on account of his Welf
blood, and others who hated him for his churlish manners.
Amongst them Frederick scattered lavishly some money he had
borrowed from the Republic of Genoa, and this generosity,
combined with his Hohenstaufen strength and daring, increased
the happy reputation that papal legates had already established
for him in many quarters.</p>

<p>In December 1212 he was crowned in Mainz. Civil war
followed, embittered by papal and imperial leagues, but in
1214 Otto IV was decisively beaten at Bouvines in the struggle
with Philip II of France that we have already described,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> and
the tide which had been previously turning against him now
swept away his few friends and last hopes. With the entry of
his young rival into the Rhineland provinces the dual Empire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
ceased to exist, and Frederick was crowned in Aachen, the old
capital of Charlemagne.</p>

<p>Innocent III had now reached the summit of his power, for
his pupil and protégé sat on the throne of Rome’s imperial
rival. In the same year he called a Council to the Lateran
Palace, the fourth gathering of its kind, to consider the two
objects dearest to his heart, ‘the deliverance of the Holy Land
and the reform of the Church Universal’. Crusading zeal,
however, he could not rouse again: to cleanse and spiritualize
the life of the Church in the thirteenth century was to prove
a task beyond men of finer fibre than Innocent: but, as an
illustration of his immense influence over Europe, the Fourth
Lateran Council with its dense submissive crowds, representative
of every land and class, was a fitting end to his pontificate.</p>

<p>In the year 1216 Innocent III died&mdash;the most powerful of all
Popes, a striking personality whose life by kindly fate did not
outlast his glory. In estimating Innocent’s ability as a statesman
there stands one blot against his record in the clear light shed
by after-events, namely, the short-sighted policy that once again
united the Kingdom of Naples to the Empire, and laid the
Papacy between the upper millstone of Lombardy and the
nether millstone of southern Italy. Excuse may be found in
Innocent’s desperate need of a champion with Otto IV threatening
his papal heritage, added to his belief in the promises of
the young Hohenstaufen to remain his faithful vassal. He also
tried to safeguard the future by making Frederick publicly
declare that he would bequeath Naples to a son who would not
stand for election to the Empire; but in trusting the word of
the young Emperor he had sown a wind from which his successors
were to reap a whirlwind.</p>

<p>The new Emperor was just twenty years old when Innocent
died. Either to please his guardian, or moved by a momentary
religious impulse, he had taken the Cross immediately after his
entry into Aachen; but the years passed and he showed himself
in no haste to fulfil the vow. Much of his time was spent
in his loved southern kingdom, where he completed Innocent’s
work of reducing to submission the Saracen population that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
had remained in Sicily since the Mahometan conquest.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> As
infidels the Papacy had regarded these Arabs with special hatred;
but Frederick, once assured that they were so weak that they
would be in future dependent on his favour, began protecting instead
of persecuting them. He also encouraged their silk industry
by building them a town, Lucera, on the Neapolitan coast, where
they could pursue it undisturbed; while he enrolled large
numbers of Arab warriors in his army, and used them to enforce
his will on the feudal aristocracy, descendants of the Norman
adventurers of the eleventh century.</p>

<p>So successful was he in playing off one section of his subjects
against another, opposing or aiding the different classes as
policy dictated, that he soon reigned as an autocrat in Naples.
Many of the nobles’ strongholds were levelled with the dust:
their claim to wage private war was forbidden on pain of death:
cases were taken away from their law-courts and those of the
feudal bishops to be decided by royal justices: towns were
deprived of their freedom to elect their own magistrates, while
crown officials sent from Palermo administered the laws, and
imposed and collected taxes.</p>

<p>On the whole these changes were beneficial, for private privileges
had been greatly abused in Naples, and Frederick, like
Philip Augustus or the Angevin Henry II, had the instinct and
ability to govern well when he chose. Nevertheless the subjugation
of ‘the Kingdom’, as Naples was usually called in Italy,
was of course received with loud outcries of anger by Neapolitan
barons and churchmen, who hastened to inform the Holy See
that their ruler loved infidels better than Christians and kept an
eastern harem at Palermo.</p>

<p>Honorius III, the new Pope, accepted such reports and
scandals with dismay. He had himself noted uneasily
Frederick’s absorption in Italian affairs and frequently reminded
him of his crusading vow. Being gentle and slow to commit himself
to any decided step however, it was not till the Hohenstaufen
deliberately broke his promise to Innocent III, and had his eldest
son Henry crowned King of the Romans as well as King of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Naples, thus acknowledging him as his heir in both Germany and
Italy, that Honorius’s wrath flamed into a threat of excommunication.
For a time it spread no farther, since Frederick was lavish
in explanations and in promises of friendship that he had no intention
of fulfilling, while the old Pope chose to believe him rather
than risk an actual conflagration. At last, however, the patient
Honorius died.</p>

<p>Gregory IX, the new Pope, was of the family of Innocent, and
shared to the full his views of the world-wide supremacy of the
Church. An old man of austere life and feverish energy, he regarded
Frederick as a monster of ingratitude and became almost
hysterical and quite unreasonable in his efforts to humble him.
Goaded by his constant reproaches and threats, the Emperor
began to make leisurely preparations at Brindisi for his crusade;
but when he at last started, an epidemic of fever, to which he
himself fell a victim, forced him to put back to port. Gregory,
refusing to believe in this illness as anything more than an excuse
for delay, at once excommunicated him; and then, though
Frederick set sail as soon as he was well enough, repeated the
ban, giving as his reason that the Emperor had not waited to
receive his pardon for the first offence like an obedient son of
the Church.</p>

<p>A crusader excommunicated by the Head of Christendom first
for not fulfilling his vow and then for fulfilling it! This was a
degrading and ridiculous sight; and Frederick, now definitely
hostile to Rome, continued on his way, determined with
obstinate pride that, if not for the Catholic Faith, then for his
own glory, he would carry out his purpose. The Templars refused
him support: the Christians still left in the neighbourhood
of Acre helped him half-heartedly or stood aloof, frightened by
the warnings of their priests; but Frederick achieved more
without the Pope’s aid than other crusaders had done of late
years with his blessing. By force of arms, and still more by
skilful negotiations, he obtained from the Sultan possession of
Jerusalem, and entering in triumph placed on his head the crown
of the Latin kings.</p>

<p>His vow fulfilled, he sailed for Sicily, and the Pope, whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
troops in Frederick’s absence had been harrying ‘the Kingdom’,
hastily patched up a peace at San Germano. ‘I will remember
the past no more,’ cried Frederick, but anger burned within him
at papal hostility. ‘The Emperor has come to me with the
zeal of a devoted son,’ said Gregory, but there was no trust in
his heart that corresponded to his words.</p>

<p>A Hohenstaufen, who had taken Jerusalem unaided, supreme
in Naples, supreme also in Germany, stretching out his imperial
sceptre over Lombardy! What Pope, who believed that the
future of the Church rested on the temporal independence of
Rome, could sleep tranquilly in his bed with such a vision?</p>

<p>It is not possible to describe here in any detail the renewed
war between Empire and Papacy that followed the inevitable
breakdown of the treaty of San Germano. Very bitter was the
spirit in which it was waged on both sides. Frederick, whatever
his intentions, could not forget that it was the Father of
Christendom who had tried to ruin his crusade. The remembrance
did not so much shake his faith as wake in him an
exasperated sense of injustice that rendered him deaf to those
who counselled compromise. Unable to rid himself wholly of
the fear of papal censure, he yet saw clearly enough that the sin
for which Popes relentlessly pursued him was not his cruelty,
nor profligacy, nor even his toleration of Saracens, but the
fact that he was King of Naples as well as Holy Roman
Emperor.</p>

<p>To a man of Frederick’s haughty temperament there was but
one absolution he could win for this crime, so to master Rome
that he could squeeze her judgements to his fancy like a sponge
between his strong fingers. ‘Italy is my heritage,’ he wrote to
the Pope, ‘and all the world knows it.’</p>

<p>In his passionate determination to obtain this heritage statesmanship
was thrown to the winds. He had planned a strong
monarchy in Naples, but in Germany he undermined the foundations
of royal authority that Barbarossa and Henry VI had
begun to lay. ‘Let every Prince’, he declared, ‘enjoy in peace,
according to the improved custom of his land, his immunities,
jurisdictions, counties and hundreds, both those which belong to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
him in full right, and those which have been granted out to him
in fief.’</p>

<p>The Italian Hohenstaufen only sought from his northern
kingdom, whose good government he thus carelessly sacrificed
to feudal anarchy, sufficient money to pay for his campaigns
beyond the Alps and leisure to pursue them. In the words of a
modern historian, ‘he bartered his German kingship for an
immediate triumph over his hated foe.’</p>

<p>At first victory rewarded his energy and skill. His hereditary
enemy, the ‘Lombard League’, had tampered with the loyalty
of his eldest son, Henry, King of the Romans, whom he had left
to rule in Germany: but Frederick discovered the plot in time
and deposed and imprisoned the culprit. In despair at the
prospect of lifelong imprisonment held out to him, the young
Henry flung himself to his death down a steep mountain-side;
and Conrad, his younger brother, a boy of eight, was crowned in
his stead.</p>

<p>In North Italy Frederick pursued the policy not so much of
trampling down resistance with his German levies, like his
grandfather Barbarossa, as of employing Italian nobles of the
Ghibelline party, whom he supported and financed that they
might fight his battles and make his wrath terrible in the popular
hearing. Such were Eccelin de Romano and his brother
Alberigo, lords of Verona and Vicenza, whose tyranny and
cruelties seemed abnormal even in their day.</p>

<p>‘The Devil’s own Servant’ Eccelin is called by a contemporary,
who describes how he slaughtered in cold blood eleven
thousand prisoners.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘I believe, in truth, no such wicked man has been from the
beginning of the world unto our own days: for all men trembled
at him as a rush quivers in the water ... he who lived to-day
was not sure of the morrow, the father would seek out and slay
his son, and the son his father or any of his kinsfolk to please
this man.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Alberigo ‘hanged twenty-five of the greatest men of Treviso
who had in no wise offended or harmed him’; and as the
prisoners struggled in their death agonies he thrust among their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
feet their wives, daughters, and sisters, whom he afterwards
turned adrift half-naked to seek protection where they might.</p>

<p>Revenge when this ‘Limb of Satan’ fell into the hands of his
enemies was of a brutality to match; for Alberigo and his young
sons were torn in pieces by an infuriated mob, his wife and
daughters burned alive, ‘though they were noble maidens and
the fairest in the world and guiltless.’</p>

<p>Passions ran too deep between Guelf and Ghibelline to
distinguish innocency, or to spare youth or sex. Cruelty, the
most despicable and infectious of vices, was the very atmosphere
of the thirteenth century, desecrating what has been described
from another aspect as ‘an age of high ideals and heroic lives’.</p>

<p>It is remarked with some surprise by contemporaries that
Frederick II could pardon a joke at his own expense; but on
the other hand we read of his cutting off the thumb of a notary
who had misspelt his name, and callously ordering one of his
servants, by way of amusement, to dive and dive again into the
sea after a golden cup, until from sheer exhaustion he reappeared
no more.</p>

<p>At Cortenuova the Lombard League was decisively beaten
by the imperial forces, the <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">carroccio</i> of Milan seized and
burned. Frederick, flushed with success, now declared that not
only North but also Middle Italy was subject to his allegiance,
and replied to a new excommunication by advancing into
Romagna and besieging some of the papal towns. Gregory,
worn out by grief and fury, died as his enemy approached the
gates of Rome: and his immediate successor, unnerved by
excitement, followed him to the grave before the cardinals who
had elected him could proceed to his consecration.</p>

<p>Innocent IV, who now ascended the papal throne, had of old
shown some sympathy to the imperial cause; but Frederick,
when he heard of his election, is reported to have said, ‘I have
lost a friend, for no Pope can be a Ghibelline.’ With the example
of Otto IV in his mind he should have added that no Emperor
could remain a Guelf.</p>

<p>Frederick had indeed gained an inveterate enemy, more
dangerous than Gregory IX, because more politic and discreet.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
From Lyons, whither he had fled, Innocent IV maintained
unflinchingly the claims he could no longer set forth in Rome,
declaring the victorious Emperor excommunicate and deposed.
‘Has the Pope deposed me?’ asked Frederick scornfully, when
the news came. ‘Bring me my crowns that I may see what he
has taken away!’</p>

<p>One after another he placed on his head the seven crowns his
attendants brought him, the royal crown of Germany and imperial
diadem of Rome, the iron circlet of Lombardy, the crowns of
Jerusalem, of Burgundy, of Sardinia, and of Sicily and Naples.
‘See!’ he said, ‘Are they not all mine still? and none shall
take them from me without a struggle.’</p>

<p>So the hideous war between Welf and Waiblingen, between
Guelf and Ghibelline continued, and Germany and Italy were
deluged with blood and flames. ‘After the Emperor Frederick
was put under the ban,’ says a German chronicler, ‘the robbers
rejoiced over the spoils. Then were the ploughshares beaten
into swords and reaping-hooks into lances. No one went anywhere
without flint and steel to set on fire whatever he could
kindle.’</p>

<p>The ebb from the high-water mark of the Emperor’s fortunes
was marked by the revolt and successful resistance of the Guelf
city of Parma to the imperial forces&mdash;a defeat Frederick might
have wiped out in fresh victory had not his own health begun to
fail. In 1250 he died, still excommunicate, snatched away to
hell, according to his enemies, not dead, according to many who
from love or hate believed his personality of more than human
endurance.</p>

<p>Yet Frederick, whether for good or ill, had perished, and with
him his imperial ambitions. Popes might tremble at other
nightmares, but the supremacy of the Holy Roman Empire over
Italy would no more haunt their dreams for many years. Naples
also, to whose conquest and government he had devoted the
best of his brain and judgement, was torn from his heirs and
presented by his papal enemy to the French House of Anjou.
Struggling against these usurpers the last of the royal line of
Hohenstaufen, Conradin, son of Conrad, a lad of fifteen, gallant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
and reckless as his grandfather, was captured in battle and
beheaded.</p>

<p>Frederick had destroyed in Germany and built on sand elsewhere;
and of all his conquests and achievements only their
memory was to dazzle after-generations. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Stupor et Gloria Mundi</i>
he was called by those who knew him, and in spite of his ultimate
failure and his vices he still remains a ‘wonder of the world’,
set above enemies and friends by his personality, the glory of his
courage, his audacity, and his strength of purpose.</p>

<span class="subhead">LEARNING AND ECCLESIASTICAL ORGANIZATION
IN THE MIDDLE AGES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The word ‘progress’ implies to modern men and women
a moving forward towards a perfection as yet unknown, freshly
imagined indeed by each generation: to the Middle Ages it
meant rather a peering back through the mist of barbarian
invasions to an idealized Christian Rome. Inspiration lay in the
past, not merely in such political conceptions as the Holy Roman
Empire, but in the domain of art and thought, where too often
tradition laid her choking grip upon originality struggling for
expression.</p>

<p>The painting of the early Middle Ages was stereotyped in the
stiff though beautiful models of Byzantium, that ‘Fathers of the
Church’ had insisted, by means of decrees passed at Church
councils, should be considered as fitting representations of
Christian subjects for all time. Less impressive but more lifelike
were the illuminations of missals and holy books, that, in
illustrating the Gospels or lives of the Saints, reproduced the
artist’s own surroundings&mdash;the noble he could see from the window
of his cell ride by with hawk or hounds, the labourer sowing or
delving, the merchant with his money-bags, the man of fashion
trailing his furred gown.</p>

<p>Vignettes such as these, with their neat craftsmanship of line
and colour, their almost photographic love of detail, lend a reality
to our glimpses of life in Europe from the twelfth to the fourteenth
centuries; yet great as is the debt we owe them, the real art of
the Middle Ages was not consummated with the brush but with
the builder’s tools and sculptor’s chisel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mediaeval Architecture</div>

<p>Like the painter’s, the architect’s impulse was at first almost
entirely religious, though guild-halls and universities followed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
on the erection of churches and monasteries. Nourished on
St. Augustine’s belief in this life as a mere transitory journey
towards the eternal ‘City of God’, mediaeval men and women
saw this pilgrimage encompassed with a vast army of devils and
saints, ranged in constant battle for the human soul. Only
through faith and the kindly assistance of the Saints could man
hope to beat off the legions of hell which hung like a pack of
wolves about his footsteps, and nowhere with greater efficacy
than in the sanctuary from which human prayer arose daily to
God’s throne.</p>

<p>Churches and chapels in modern times have become the
property of a section of the public&mdash;that is, of those who think
or believe in a certain way; and sometimes through poverty of
purse or spirit, through bad workmanship or material, the
architecture that results is shoddy or insignificant. In the
Middle Ages his parish church was the most certain fact in
every Christian’s existence, from the day he was carried to the
font for baptism until his last journey to rest beneath its shadow.
Here he would make his confessions, his vows of repentance and
amendment, and offer his worship and thanksgiving: here he
would often find a fortified refuge from violence in the street
outside, a school, a granary, a parish council-chamber.</p>

<p>What more natural than that mediaeval artists, their souls
attune with the hopes and fears of their age, should realize their
genius best in constructing and ornamenting buildings that were
to all citizens alike the symbol of their belief? ‘Let us build,’
said the people of Siena in the thirteenth century, ‘such a church
to the glory of God that all men shall wonder!’</p>

<p>The cathedral, when completed, was but a third in size and
grandeur of the original design, for the Black Death fell upon
Siena and carried off her builders in the midst of their work;
yet it remains magnificently arresting to modern eyes, as though
the faith of those who planned and fashioned its slabs of black
and white marble for the love of God and their city had breathed
into their workmanship something of the mediaeval soul.</p>

<p>The same is true of ‘Nôtre Dame de la Victoire’ in Paris,
founded by Philip Augustus, of which Victor Hugo says ‘each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
face, each stone, is a page of history’. It is true of nearly all
mediaeval churches that have outlived the ravages of war and
fire, memorials of an age, that if it lagged behind our own in
ultimate achievement, was pre-eminent in one art at least&mdash;ecclesiastical
architecture.</p>

<p>Where the architect stopped the mediaeval sculptor took up
his work, at first with simple severity but later in a riot of
imagination that peopled façades, vaulted roofs, and capitals of
columns with the angels, demons, and hybrid monsters that
haunted the fancy of the day. The flying buttress, the invention
of which made possible lofty clerestories with vast expanses of
window, brought to perfection another art, the painting of glass.
Here also the mediaeval artist excelled, and the crucibles in
which he mixed the colours that hold us wrapt before the windows
of Leon, Albi, and Chartres, still keep unsolved the secret of their
transparent delicacy and depth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Learning and Church Organization</div>

<p>In the architecture, the sculpture, and in the stained glass of
the Middle Ages we see original genius at work, but in learning
and culture Europe was slower to throw off the giant influence
of Rome. Even under the crushing inroads of barbarian
ignorance Italy had managed to keep alive the study of classical
authors and of Roman law. Latin remained the language of the
educated man or woman, the language in which the services of
the Church were recited, sermons were preached, correspondence
carried on, business transacted, and students in universities and
schools addressed by their professors.</p>

<p>The advantages of a common tongue can be imagined: the
comparative ease with which a pope or king could keep in touch
with bishops or subjects of a different race; the accessibility
of the best books to students of all nations, since scarcely
a mediaeval author of repute would condescend to employ his
own tongue: above all perhaps the ease with which an ambassador,
a merchant, or a pilgrim could make himself understood on
a journey across Europe, instead of torturing his brain with
struggles after the right word in first one foreign dialect and
then another.</p>

<p>This classical form, so rigidly withholding knowledge from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
grasp of the ignorant, had also its disadvantage; for many
a mediaeval pen, that could have flown across the vellum in
joyful intimacy in its owner’s tongue, stumbled clumsily amidst
Latin constructions, leaving in the end not a spontaneous record
of current events, but a ‘dry-as-dust’ catalogue, in bad imitation
of some Latin stylist. The modern world is more grateful to
mediaeval culture for such lapses as Dante’s <cite>Divina Commedia</cite>
than for all the heavy Latin tomes, whose authors hoped for
laurelled immortality.</p>

<p>For those in England and France who could not easily master
Latin or found its stately periods too cumbrous for ordinary
conversation, French, descended from the spoken Latin of the
Roman soldier or merchant in Gaul, was in the Middle Ages, as
to-day, the language of polite society. It possessed two distinct
dialects, the ‘langue d’œil’ and the ‘langue d’oc’, so called
because the northern Frenchman, including the Norman, was
supposed to pronounce <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">oui</i> as <em>œil</em>, while his southern fellow
countryman pronounced it as <em>oc</em>.</p>

<p>England, where, ever since the Conquest of William I,
French had been the natural tongue of a semi-foreign court, owed
an enormous literary impulse to the ‘langue d’œil’ during
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries; while the ‘langue d’oc’ that
gave its name to a district in the south of France shared its
poetry and romance between Provençals and Catalans. The
descendants of the former are to-day French, of the latter
Spanish: but in the eleventh century they were fellow subjects
of the Counts of Toulouse, who ruled over a district stretching
from the source of the Rhone to the Mediterranean, from the
Italian Alps to the Ebro.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mediaeval Culture</div>

<p>In this semi-independent kingdom there developed a civilization
and culture of hot-house growth, precocious in its appreciation
of the less violent pleasures of life, such as love, art, music,
literature, but often corrupt in their enjoyment. The gay court
of Toulouse paid no heed to St. Augustine’s hell, whose fears
haunted the rest of Europe in its more thoughtful moments.
Joyous and inconsequent, it lived for the passing hour, and out
of its atmosphere of dalliance and culture was born a race of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
poet-singers. These troubadours (<em>trouvers</em> = discoverers) sang
of love, whose silken fetters could hold in thrall knights and fair
ladies; and their golden lyrics, now plaintive, now gay, were
carried to the crowded cities of Italy and Spain, or found schools
of imitators elsewhere, as in Germany amongst her thirteenth-century
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">minnesingers</i> (love-singers). In the north of France and
in England appeared minstrels also, but their themes were less
of love than of battle; and audiences revelled by castle and
camp-fire in the ‘gestes’ or ‘deeds’ of Charlemagne and his
Paladins, the chivalry of Arthur and his Knights, or in stirring
Border ballads such as Chevy Chase.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mediaeval Universities</div>

<p>The market-place, the camp, and the baronial hall, where were
sung or recited these often imaginary stories of the past, were
the schools of the many unlettered; just as the conversation of
Arabs and Jews around the desert fires had stimulated the
imagination of the young Mahomet; but for the few who could
afford a sounder education there were the universities&mdash;Paris,
Bologna, Oxford, to name but three of the most famous.</p>

<p>The word <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">universitas</i> implied in the Middle Ages a union
of men; such a corporation as the ‘guilds’ formed by fishmongers
and drapers to protect their trade interests; and the universities
had indeed originated for a similar purpose. Cities to-day that
have universities in their midst are proud of the fact, and
welcome new students; but in early mediaeval times an influx
of young men of all ages from every part of Europe, many of
them wild and unruly, some so poor that they must beg or steal
their daily bread, was at first sight a very doubtful blessing.
Street fights between nationalities who hated one another on
principle, or between bands of students and citizens, were
a common occurrence in the towns that learning honoured with
her presence, and had their usual accompaniment of broken
heads, fires, and looting. But for the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">universitas</i> formed by
masters and students to control and protect their members, these
centres of education would probably have been stamped out by
indignant tradesmen: as it was they had to fight for their
existence.</p>

<p>Municipalities looked with no lenient eye upon a corporation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
that seemed to them a ‘state within a state’, threatening their
own right to govern all within the city. It was not until after
many generations that they understood the meaning of the word
co-operation, that is, the possibility of assisting instead of
hindering the work of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">universitas</i>. Sometimes a king
like Philip Augustus insisted on toleration by granting to his
students the ‘privilege of clergy’, but as the University grew it
became able to enforce its own lessons. In the thirteenth century
the Masters of Paris closed their lecture-halls and led away their
flock, in protest for what they considered unfair treatment by
the city authorities during a riot, and their absence taught
Parisians that, in spite of head-breakings, the students were an
asset, not a loss, to municipal life. Under the protection therefore
of a papal ‘bull’, they returned a few weeks later in triumph to
the Latin Quarter.</p>

<p>It was only by degrees that colleges where the students could
live were erected, or that anything resembling the elaborate
organization of a modern university was evolved. Students
lodged where they could, and ‘masters’ lived on the goodwill
of those who paid their fees, and starved if their popularity
waned and with it their audience. The life of both teacher and
pupil was vague and hazardous, with a background of poverty
and crime lurking at the street corners to ruin the unwary or
foolish. Nor was the period of study a mere ‘passing sojourn’
like some modern ‘terms’: the Bachelor of Arts at Oxford or
Paris must be a student of five years’ standing, the Master of
Arts calculated on devoting three years more to gaining his final
degree, a Doctor of Theology would be faced with eight years’
hard work at least. It might almost be said that higher education
under these circumstances became a profession.</p>

<p>To Bologna, the greatest of Italian universities, went those
who wished to study Roman law at the fountain-head. This
does not mean to stir up the legal dust of a dead empire out of
a student’s curiosity, but to master a living system of law that
barbarian invaders had gradually grafted on to their own
national codes. In the eleventh century the laws of Justinian<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
were as much or more revered than in his own day. We
have seen that Frederick Barbarossa set the lawyers of Bologna
to work to justify from old legal documents the claims he wished
to establish over Lombardy; and when they had succeeded to
his satisfaction he rewarded them with gifts and knighthood,
showing what value he put on their achievement. This is a very
good example of the respect felt by mediaeval minds for the laws
and title-deeds of an earlier age, even though the tyranny that
resulted led the ‘Lombard League’ to dispute such claims.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mediaeval Papal Government</div>

<p>Still more closely allied than the civil codes of Europe to the
old Roman legal texts was the ‘Canon’ law of the Church that
had been directly based upon classic models; and with the rise
of Hildebrand’s world-wide ambitions its decisions assumed
a growing importance and demanded an enormous army of
trained lawyers to interpret and arrange them. For youths of
a practical and ambitious turn of mind here was a course of study
leading to a profession profitable in all ages; and a text-book
was provided for such budding lawyers in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">decretum</i> of
Gratian, a monk who in the twelfth century compiled a full and
authoritative text of Canon law.</p>

<p>The existence of the Ecclesiastical Courts, in which Canon law
was administered, we have already mentioned in discussing the
quarrel of Henry II of England and Thomas Becket.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> Founded
originally to deal with purely ecclesiastical cases and officials,
they tended in time to draw within their competence any one over
whom the Church could claim protection and any causes that
affected the rites of the Catholic Church. It was a wide net
with a very small mesh, as the Angevin Henry II and other lay
rulers of Europe found. The protection that spread its wings
over priests and clerks stretched also to crusaders, widows, and
orphans: the jurisdiction of the Church Courts claimed not
merely moral questions such as heresy, sacrilege, and perjury,
but all matters connected with probate of wills, marriage and
divorce, and even libel.</p>

<p>Rome became a hive of ecclesiastical lawyers, with the Pope,
like the Roman emperors of old, the supreme law-giver and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
final court of appeal for all Church Courts of Europe. His rule
was absolute, at least in theory, for by his power of ‘dispensation’
he could set aside, if he considered advisable, the very Canon law
his officials administered. He could also summon to his <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">curia</i>,
or papal court, any case on which he wished to pronounce judgement,
at whatever stage in its litigation in an inferior ecclesiastical
court.</p>

<p>Under the Pope in an ordered hierarchy, corresponding to the
feudal arrangement of lay society, came the metropolitans, who
received from his hand or from those of his legates the narrow
woollen scarf, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pallium</i>, that was the symbol of their authority.
Next in order came the diocesan bishops with their ‘officials’,
the archdeacons and rural deans, each with their own court and
measure of jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The Pope’s will went forth to Christendom in the form of letters
called ‘bulls’, from the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">bulla</i> or heavy seal that was attached
to them. Against those who paid no heed to their contents he
could hurl either the weapon of excommunication&mdash;that is, of
personal outlawry from the Church&mdash;or else, if the offender
were a king or a city, the still more blasting ‘interdict’ that fell
on ruler and ruled alike. The land that groaned under an
interdict was bereft of all spiritual comfort: no priest might say
public Mass, baptize a new-born child, perform the marriage
service, console the dying with ‘supreme unction’, or bury the
dead. The very church bells would ring no more.</p>

<p>It was under this pressure of spiritual starvation, when the
Saints seemed to have withdrawn their sheltering arms and the
demons to have gathered joyfully to a harvest of lost souls, that
John of England was brought by the curses of his people to turn
to Rome in repentance and submission. Yet, as in the case of
most weapons, familiarity bred contempt, and too frequent use of
powers of ‘interdict’ and ‘excommunication’ was to blunt their
efficacy&mdash;a Frederick II, the oft-excommunicated, proved able to
conquer Jerusalem and dominate Italy even under the papal ban.</p>

<p>The Church, in her claims to world empire, demanded in truth
an obedience it was beyond her ability to enforce. She also laid
herself open to temptations to which from the nature of her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
temporal ambitions she must inevitably succumb. No such
elaborate and expensive administration as emanated from her
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">curia</i> could continue without an inexhaustible flow of money
into her treasury. Lawyers, priests, legates, cardinals, the Pope
himself, had each to be maintained in a state befitting their office
in the eyes of a world, as ready in the thirteenth century as in
the twentieth to judge by appearances and offer its homage
accordingly.</p>

<p>In addition to the ordinary expenses of a ruler, whose court
was a centre of religious and intellectual life for Europe, there
was the constant burden of war, first with neighbouring Italian
rulers and then with the Empire. Innocent IV triumphed over
the Hohenstaufen; but largely by dipping his hands into English
money-bags, to such an extent indeed during the reign of John’s
son, Henry III, that England gained the scoffing name of the
‘milch cow of the Papacy’.</p>

<p>At first, when the ecclesiastical courts had offered to criminals
a justice at once more humane and comprehensive than the rough-and-ready
tyranny of a king or feudal lord, the upholders of the
rights of Canon law were regarded as popular heroes. Later,
however, with the growth of national feeling and the development
and better administration of the civil codes, men and women
began to falter in their allegiance. Canon law was found to be
both expensive and tardy, especially in the case of ‘appeals’, that
is, of cases, called from some inferior court to Rome. The key
also to the judgements given at Rome was often too obviously
gold and of heavy weight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Papal Exactions</div>

<p>Nor was justice alone to be bought or sold. A large part of
the money that filled the Roman treasury was derived from
benefices and livings in different countries of Europe that had
by one means or another accumulated in papal hands. The
constant pressure of the wars with emperors and Italian
Ghibellines made it necessary for the Popes to administer this
patronage as profitably as possible; and so the spiritual needs
of dioceses and parishes became sacrificed to the military calls
on the Roman treasury.</p>

<p>Sometimes it was not a living itself for which a clerical candidate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
paid heavily, but merely the promise of ‘preferment’ to the next
vacancy; or he would pledge himself in the case of nomination
to send his ‘firstfruits’, that is, his first year’s revenue, to
Rome. Those who could afford the requisite sum might be
natives of the country in which the vacant bishopric or living
occurred; often they were not, and the successful nominee, instead
of going in person to exercise his duties, would merely send an
agent to collect his dues. These dues came from many different
sources, but in the case of livings principally from the ‘tithe’, a
tax for the maintenance of the Church, supposed to represent
one-tenth of every man’s income.</p>

<p>People usually grumble when they are continually asked for
money, and mediaeval men and women were no exception to
this rule. Thus, to take the case of England, while the wars
between Emperor and Pope left her comparatively indifferent as
to the issues involved, the growing exactions of the Roman <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">curia</i>
that touched her pockets awoke a smouldering resentment that
every now and then flared into hostility.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>’In these times’, wrote the chronicler, Matthew Paris, ‘the
small fire of faith began to grow exceeding chill, so that it was
well nigh reduced to ashes ... for now was simony practised without
shame.... Every day illiterate persons of the lowest class,
armed with bulls from Rome, feared not to plunder the revenues
which our pious forefathers had assigned for the maintenance of
the Religious, the support of the poor, and the sustaining of
strangers.’</p></blockquote>

<p>At Oxford in the reign of Henry III (1216–72), the papal
legate was forced to fly from the town by indignant ‘clerks’ of the
university, or undergraduates as we should call them to-day.
‘Where is that usurer, that simoniac, that plunderer of revenues,
that thirster for money?’ they cried, as they hunted him and his
retinue through the streets, ‘it is he who perverts the King and
subverts the kingdom to enrich foreigners with our spoils.’</p>

<p>At Lincoln Bishop Grosstete indignantly refused to invest
Innocent IV’s nephew, a boy of twelve, with the next vacant
prebendary of his cathedral. Other papal relatives were absorbing
livings and bishoprics elsewhere in Europe, for under
Innocent IV began the open practice of ‘nepotism’, that is, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Popes using their revenues and their office in order to provide
for their nephews and other members of their families.</p>

<p>‘He laid aside all shame,’ says Matthew Paris of this Pope,
‘he extorted larger sums of money than any before him.’ The
‘sums of money’ enabled Rome to cast down her imperial foe,
but the extortion was a dangerous expedient. Throughout the
early Middle Ages the Pope had been accepted by Western
Christendom as speaking for the Church with the voice of Christ’s
authority. In his disputes with kings the latter could never be
sure of the loyalty of their people, should they call on them to
take up arms against the ‘Holy Father’.</p>

<p>With the growth of nations and of Rome as a temporal power
a gradual change came over the European outlook; subjects
were more inclined to obey rulers whom they knew than a distant
potentate whom they did not; they were also less ready to accept
papal interference without criticism. Thus a distinction was for
the first time drawn between the Pope and the Church.</p>

<p>When King Hako of Norway was offered the imperial crown
on the deposition of Frederick II by Innocent IV, he refused,
saying, ‘I will gladly fight the enemies of the Church, but I will
not fight against the foes of the Pope.’ His words were significant
of a new spirit. In the feuds of Guelfs and Ghibellines that
racked the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were laid the foundations
of a movement to control the Popes by Universal Councils
in the fifteenth, and of that still more drastic opposition to his
powers in the sixteenth that we call the Reformation.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FAITH OF THE MIDDLE AGES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>A modern student, when he passes from school to a university,
soon finds that he is standing at a cross-roads: he cannot hope,
like a philosopher of the sixteenth century, to ‘take all knowledge
for his province’, but must choose which of the many signposts
he will follow&mdash;law, classics, science, economics, chemistry,
medicine, to name but a few of the more important. Mediaeval
minds would have been sorely puzzled by some of these
avenues of knowledge, while the rest they would denounce as
mere sidetracks, leading by a devious route to the main high
road of theology. Science, for instance, the patient searching
after truth by building up knowledge from facts, and accepting
nothing as a fact that had not been verified by proof, was a closed
book in the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Roger Bacon, an English friar, one of the first to attempt
scientific experiments, was regarded with such suspicion on
account of his researches and his sarcastic comments on the
views of his day that he was believed to be in league with
the devil; and even the favour of a pope more enlightened
than most of his contemporaries could not save him in later years
from imprisonment as a suspected magician.</p>

<p>Men and women hate to change the ideas in which they have
been brought up; and in the thirteenth century they readily
accepted as facts such fabulous stories told by early Christian
writers as that of the phoenix who at five hundred years old
casts herself into a sacred fire, emerging renewed in health and
vigour from her own ashes, or of the pelican killing her young
at birth and reviving them in three days, or of the unicorn
resisting all the wiles of the hunter but captured easily by a pure
maiden. The charm of such natural history lay to mediaeval<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
minds not in its legendary quaintness but in the use to which it
could be turned in pointing a moral or adorning the doctrines
of theology.</p>

<p>Theology was the chief course of study at Paris, just as Roman
law reigned at Bologna. It comprised a thorough mastery
of the Scriptures as expounded by ‘Fathers of the Church’, and
also of what was then known through Latin and Arabic translations
of the works of the Greek philosopher Aristotle. Although
he had been a pagan, Aristotle was almost as much revered by
many mediaeval theologians as St. Jerome or St. Augustine, and
it was their life-work to try and reconcile his views with those of
Catholic Christianity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scholasticism</div>

<p>The philosophy that resulted from the study of these very
different authorities is called ‘scholasticism’, and those who gave
patient years of thought to the arguments that built up and
maintained its theories the ‘schoolmen’.</p>

<p>The first of the great Paris theologians was Peter Abelard,
a Breton&mdash;handsome, self-confident, ready of tongue and brain.
Having studied ‘dialectics’, that is, the system of reasoning by
which the mediaeval mind constructed its philosophy, he aroused
the disgust of his masters by drawing away their pupils, through
his eloquence and originality, as soon as he understood the
subject-matter sufficiently to lecture on his own account.</p>

<p>In Paris so many young men of his day crowded round his
desk that Abelard has been sometimes called the founder of the
university. This is not true, but his popularity may be said to
have decided that Paris rather than any other town should
become the intellectual centre of France. Greedily his audience
listened while he endeavoured to prove by human reason beliefs
that the Church taught as a matter of faith; and, though he had
set out with the intention of defending her, it was with the
Church that he soon came into conflict.</p>

<p>One of his books, called <cite>Yes and No</cite>, contained a brief
summary of the views of early Christian Fathers on various
theological questions. Drawn into such close proximity some
of these views were found to conflict, and the Breton lecturer
became an object of suspicion in ecclesiastical quarters, especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
to St. Bernard of Clairvaux, who believed that human reason
was given to man merely that he might accept the teaching of the
Church, not to raise arguments or criticisms concerning it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Peter Abelard’, he wrote to the Pope, ‘is trying to make void
the merit of Christian faith when he deems himself able by human
reason to comprehend God altogether ... the man is great in
his own eyes ... this scrutinizer of Majesty and fabricator of
heresies.’</p></blockquote>

<p>The minds of the two men were indeed utterly opposed&mdash;types
of conflicting human thought in all ages. St. Bernard, in spite
of his frank denunciations of the sins of the Church, was docile
to the voice of her authority, and hated and feared the pride
of the human intellect as the deadliest of all sins. Abelard, by
nature inquisitive and sceptical, regarded his deft brain as
a surgeon’s knife, given him to cut away diseased or worn-out
tissues from the thought of his day in order to leave it healthier
and purer.</p>

<p>As antagonists they were no match, for St. Bernard was infinitely
the greater man, without any of the other’s petty vanity and
worldliness to confuse the issue for which they struggled: he had
behind him also the sympathy of mediaeval minds not as yet
awakened to any spirit of inquiry, and so the Breton was driven
into the retirement of a monk’s cell and his condemned works
publicly burned.</p>

<p>One of his pupils, Peter Lombard, adopted his master’s
methods without arousing the anger of the orthodox by any
daring feats of controversy, and produced a <cite>Book of Sentences</cite>
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sententiae</i> = opinions) that became the text-book for scholasticism,
just as the <cite>Decretum</cite> was the authority for students of Roman
law. Without being a work of genius the <cite>Sentences</cite> cleared
a pathway through the jungle of mediaeval thought for more
original minds, while the discovery in the latter half of the
twelfth century of several hitherto unknown works of Aristotle
gave added zest to the researches of the ‘Schoolmen’. Greatest
of all these ‘Schoolmen’ was Thomas Aquinas, ‘the Angelic
Doctor’, as he has sometimes been called.</p>

<p>Aquinas was a Neapolitan of noble family, who ran away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
from home as a boy to join the Dominicans, an Order of wandering
preachers of whose foundation we shall shortly speak.
Thomas was recaptured and brought home by his elder
brother, a noble at the court of Frederick II; but neither threats
nor imprisonment could persuade the young novice to give up
the life he had chosen. After a year he broke the bars of his
window, escaped from Naples, and went to Cologne and Paris,
where he studied theology, emerging from this education the
greatest lecturer and teacher of his day. In his <cite>Summa Theologiae</cite>,
his best-known book, he set forth his belief in man’s
highest good as the chief thought of God, using both the
commentaries of the Church Fathers and the works of Aristotle
as quarries to provide the material for fashioning his arguments.
Like Abelard, he believed in the voice of reason, but without
any of the Breton’s probing scepticism. Human reason bridled
by divine grace was the guide he sought to lead his pen through
the maze of theology; and so clear and judicial were his methods,
so brilliant the intellect that shone through his writings, that
Aquinas became for later generations an authority almost equal
to St. Augustine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mediaeval Faith</div>

<p>The intense preoccupation of mediaeval minds with theology
and the importance attached to ‘right belief’ are the most striking
mental characteristics of the period with which we are dealing.
To-day we are inclined to judge a man by his actions rather
than by his beliefs, to sum up a character as good or bad
because its owner is generous or selfish, kind or cruel, brave or
cowardly. In the twelfth or thirteenth centuries this would
have seemed a wholly false standard. The ideal of conduct, for
one thing, maintained by monks like St. Bernard of Clairvaux
was so exalted that, to the ordinary men and women in an age
of cruelty and fierce passions, a good life seemed impossible
save for Saints. The sins and failings of the rest of the world
received a very easy pardon except from ascetics; and it was
generally felt that God in His mercy, through the intercession
of the kindly Saints, would be compassionate to human weakness
so long as the sinner repented, confessed, and clung to a belief
in the teaching of the Church. This teaching, or ‘Faith’,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
declared to have been given by Christ to His Apostles, set forth
in the writings of the Christian Fathers, gathered together in
the Creeds and Sacraments defined by Church Councils, preached
and expounded by the clergy and theologians, defended by the
Pope, was the torch that could alone guide man’s wavering
footsteps to the ‘City of God’.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Do you know what I shall gain,’ asked a French Count of
the thirteenth century, ‘in that during this mortal life I have
believed as Holy Church teaches? I shall have a crown in the
Heavens above the angels, for the angels cannot but believe
inasmuch as they see God face to face.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Heresy&mdash;the refusal to accept the teaching of the Church&mdash;was
the one unpardonable sin, a moral leprosy worse in mediaeval
eyes than any human disease because it affected the soul, not
the body, and the life of the soul was everlasting. The heretic
must be suppressed, converted if possible, but if not, burned and
forgotten like a diseased rag, lest his wrong beliefs should infect
others and so lose their souls also eternally. To-day we know
that neither suppression nor burnings can ultimately extinguish
that independence of thought and spirit of inquiry that are as
much the motive power of some human natures as the acceptance
of authority is of others. Tolerance, and how far it can be
extended to actions as well as beliefs, is one of the problems
that the world is still studying. The towns and provinces, where
the first battles were fought, are sown with the blood and ashes
of those who neither sought nor offered the way of compromise
as a solution.</p>

<p>Another of Abelard’s pupils, besides the orthodox Peter
Lombard, was an Italian, Arnold of Brescia&mdash;in many ways
a man of like intellect with his master, self-centred, restless, and
ambitious. When he returned home from the University he at
once took a violent part in the life of the Brescian commune,
declaring publicly that the Church should return to the days of
‘apostolic poverty’, and urging the citizens to cast off the yoke of
their bishop. Exiled from Italy by the anger of the Pope and
clergy at his views he went again to Paris, where he taught
in the University until by the King’s command he was driven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
away. He next found a refuge in Germany under the protection
of a papal legate, who had known and admired him in earlier
days; but this news aroused the furious anger of St. Bernard.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Arnold of Brescia,’ he wrote to the legate, ‘whose speech
is honey ... whose doctrine poison, the man whom Brescia
has vomited forth, whom Rome abhors, whom France drives
into exile, whom Germany curses, whom Italy refuses to receive,
obtains thy support. To be his friend is to be the foe
of the Pope and God.’</p></blockquote>

<p>The legate contrived by mediation to reconcile the heretic
temporarily with the Church; but Arnold was by nature a firebrand,
and, having settled in Rome, soon became leader in one
of the many plots to make that city a ‘Free Town’, owing
allegiance only to the Emperor. Largely through his efforts
the Pope was compelled to go into exile; but later the Romans,
under the fear of an interdict that would deprive them of the
visits of pilgrims out of whom they usually made their living,
deserted him; and the republican leader was forced to fly.
Captured amongst the Italian hills, he was taken to Rome and
burned, his ashes being thrown into the Tiber lest they should
be claimed as relics by those of the populace who still loved
him. His judges need not have taken this precaution, for neither
Arnold’s religious nor political views could claim any large
measure of public approval in his own day. Elsewhere, indeed,
heresy and rebellion were seething, but it was not till the
beginning of the thirteenth century that the outbreak became
a vital problem for the Papacy.</p>

<p>The widest area of heresy was in the provinces of Languedoc
and Provence, to whose precocious mental development we
have already referred.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> The Counts of Toulouse no longer
ruled in the thirteenth century over any of modern Spain, but
north of the Pyrenees they were tenants-in-chief to the French
king for one of the most fertile provinces of southern France,
while as Marquesses of Provence they were vassals of the
Emperor for the country beyond the Rhone.</p>

<p>Semi-independent of the control of either of these overlords,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
Count Raymond VI presided over a court famed for its luxury
and gaiety of heart, its light morals, and unorthodox religious
views. When he received complaints from Rome that his people
were deriding the Catholic Faith and stoning his bishops and
priests, he scarcely pretended regret, for his sceptical nature
was quite unshocked by heresy, and both he and his nobles fully
approved of popular insistence on ‘apostolic poverty’, a doctrine
that enabled them to appropriate ecclesiastical lands and revenues
for their own purposes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Heresy in Languedoc</div>

<p>The heretical sects in Languedoc were many: perhaps the
most important those of the Albigenses and Waldensians. The
former practically denied Christianity, maintaining that good
and evil were co-equal powers, and that Christ’s death was of
no avail to save mankind. The Waldensians, or ‘Poor men of
Lyons’, on the other hand, had at first tried to find acceptance
for their beliefs within the Church. Peter Waldo, their founder,
a rich merchant of Lyons, had translated some of the Gospels
from Latin into the language of the countryside, and, having given
away all his goods, he travelled from village to village, preaching,
and trying with his followers to imitate the lives of the Apostles
in simplicity and poverty.</p>

<p>In spite of condemnation from the Pope, who was suspicious
of their teaching, the Waldensians increased in number. They
declared that the authority of the Bible was superior to that of
the Church, appointed ministers of their own, and denied many
of the principal articles of Faith that the Church insisted were
necessary to salvation.</p>

<p>The mediaeval Church taught that only through belief in these
articles of Faith, that is, in the Creeds and Sacraments (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sacramentum</i>
= something sacred), as administered by the clergy,
could man hope to be saved. The most important of the
Sacraments, of which there were seven, was the miracle of the
Mass, sometimes called ‘transubstantiation’. Its origin was
the Last Supper, when Christ before His crucifixion gave His
disciples bread and wine, saying ‘Take, eat, this is my body....’
‘Take, drink, this is my blood which was shed for you.’ The
mediaeval Church declared that every time at the service of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
Mass the priest offered up ‘the Host’, or consecrated bread,
Christ was sacrificed anew for the sins of the world, and that
the bread became in truth converted into the substance of His
body.</p>

<p>The Waldensians, and many sects that later broke away from
the tenets of the mediaeval Church, denied this miracle and
also the sacred character of the priests who could perform it.
According to the Church, her clergy at ordination received
through the laying on of the bishop’s hands some of the
mysterious power that Christ had given to St. Peter, conferring
on them the power also to forgive sins. No matter if the priest
became idle or vicious, he still by virtue of his ordination
retained his sacred character, and to lay hands upon him was
to incur the wrath of God.</p>

<p>Even in the twelfth century, when St. Bernard travelled in
Languedoc, he had been horrified to find ‘the sacraments no
longer sacred and priests without respect’. His attempts at
remonstrance were met with stones and threats, while the
establishment of an ‘episcopal inquisition’ to inquire into and
stamp out this hostility only increased Provençal bitterness and
determination.</p>

<p>‘I would rather be a Jew,’ was an expression of disdain in
the Middle Ages; but in Toulouse the people said, ‘I had
rather be a priest,’ and the clergy who walked abroad were
forced to conceal their tonsures for fear of assault.</p>

<p>‘Heresy can only be destroyed by solid instruction’ was
Innocent III’s first verdict. ‘It is by preaching the truth that
we sap foundations of error.’ He therefore sent some
Cistercians to hold a mission in Languedoc, and in their company
travelled a young Spaniard, Dominic de Guzman, burning
to win souls for the Faith or suffer martyrdom. The Cistercians
rode on horses with a large train of servants and with wagons
drawn by oxen to carry their clothes and their food. This display
aroused the scornful mirth of the Albigenses and Waldensians.
‘See,’ they cried, ‘the wealthy missionaries of a God
who was humble and despised, loaded with honours!’</p>

<p>Everywhere were the same ridicule and contempt, and it was in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
this moment of failure that Dominic the Spaniard interposed,
speaking earnestly to those who were with him of the contrast
between the heretic ministers in their lives of poverty and self-denial
with the luxury and worldliness of the local clergy, and
even with the ostentatious parade of his fellow preachers. Because
he had long practised austerities himself, wearing a hair
shirt, fasting often, and denying himself every pleasure, the
young Spaniard received a respectful hearing, and so fired
the Cistercians with his enthusiasm that they sent away their
horses and baggage-wagons, and set out on foot through the
country to try and win the populace by different methods.
With them went Dominic, barefoot, exulting in this opportunity
of bearing witness in the face of danger to the Faith he held so
precious.</p>

<p>The attitude of the men and women of Languedoc towards the
papal mission was no longer derisive but it remained hostile, for
they also held their Faith sacred, while all the racial prejudice
of the countryside was thrown into the balance of opposition to
Rome. Thus converts were few, and angry gatherings at which
stones were thrown at the strangers many; and so matters
drifted on and the mission grew more and more discouraged.</p>

<p>In 1208 occurred a violent crisis, for the papal legate, having
excommunicated Count Raymond of Toulouse for appropriating
certain Church lands and refusing to restore them, was murdered,
and the Count himself implicated in the crime, seeing that, as in
the case of Henry II and Becket, it had been his angry curses
that had prompted some knights to do the deed. Innocent III
at once declared the Count deposed, and preached a crusade
against him and his subjects as heretics.</p>

<p>Twenty years of bloodshed and cruelty followed; for under
the command of the French Count Simon de Montfort, an utterly
unscrupulous and brutal general, the orthodox legions of
northern France gathered at the papal summons to stamp out
the independence of the south that they had always hated as
a rival. Languedoc, her nobles and people united, fought hard
for her religious and political freedom; but the struggle was
uneven, and she was finally forced into submission. Thirty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
thousand of her sons and daughters had perished, and with
them the civilization and culture that had made the name of
Provence glorious in mediaeval Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Albigensian Crusade</div>

<p>The name of Dominic the Spaniard does not appear in the
bloodstained annals of the Albigensian Crusade. He had
advocated very different measures; and in 1216, pursuing his
ideal, received from the Pope leave to form an Order of
‘Preaching Brothers’, modelled on the Monastic Orders, except
that the ‘Friars’ (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Fratres</i> = brothers), as these monks were
called, were commanded not to live permanently in communities
but to spend their lives travelling about from village to village,
preaching as they went. They were to beg their daily bread;
and the very Order itself was forbidden to acquire wealth, their
founder hoping by this stringent rule to prevent the worldliness
that had corrupted the other religious communities.</p>

<p>Dominic, or St. Dominic, for the enthusiasm of the mediaeval
Church soon canonized him, was a son of his age in his intense
devotion to the Faith; but his spiritual outlook was beyond the
comprehension of all save a few. In Innocent III may be
found a more typical figure of the early thirteenth century; and
to Innocent’s standard, and not to that of their founder, the
followers of St. Dominic for the most part conformed.</p>

<p>Pope Innocent had advocated the driving out of error by right
teaching; but his failure by this method woke in him an exasperation
that made the obstinate heresy of Languedoc seem a moral
and social plague to be suppressed ruthlessly. Thorough in this
undertaking as in all to which he set his mind and hand, he
added to the slaughter of Simon de Montfort’s Crusade the
terrible and efficient machinery of the Inquisition, and this
during the pontificate of Gregory IX was transferred from the
jurisdiction of local bishops to that of the Papal See. The
Inquisitors, empowered to discover heresy and convert the
heretic by torture and fire, were mainly Dominicans, selected
for this task on account of their theological training and the
very devotion to the Faith on which their founder had laid such
stress.</p>

<p>The most important political fruits of the Albigensian Crusade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
were gathered by Philip II of France, who had himself stood
aloof from the struggle, although permitting and encouraging
his nobles to take the Cross. By the deposition and fall of his
powerful tenant-in-chief, the Count of Toulouse, the centre and
south of France, hitherto so proudly independent, lost a formidable
ally; and large tracts of Poitou and Aquitaine fell under
royal influence and were incorporated amongst the crown
lands.</p>

<p>This process continued under Philip’s son, Louis VIII, who
himself joined in the Crusade and marched with an army down
the valley of the Rhone, capturing Avignon, and arriving almost
at the gates of Toulouse. His sudden illness and death brought
the campaign to an end; but his widow, Blanche of Castile,
acting as regent for her son the boy King Louis IX, concluded
a treaty with the new Count of Toulouse, Raymond VII, that
left that noble a chastened and submissive vassal of both king
and pope. Amongst other things he was forced to acknowledge
one of the French king’s younger brothers as his successor in
the County of Provence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Francis of Assisi</div>

<p>It is pleasant to turn from the Albigensian Crusade, one of
the blackest pictures of the Middle Ages, to its best and brightest,
the story of St. Francis of Assisi.</p>

<p>In 1182 there was born at Assisi, a little Umbrian village,
a boy whom his mother named John, but whom his father,
a rich merchant, who had lately travelled in France, nicknamed
‘Francis’, or ‘the Frenchman’. St. Dominic had developed his
fiery faith in an austere and intensely religious home; but
Francis shared the light-hearted sociable intercourse of an
Italian town, and in boyhood was distinguished only from his
fellows by his generosity, innate purity, and irrepressible joy
in life.</p>

<p>When he grew up, Francis went to fight with the forces of
Assisi against the neighbouring city of Perugia, and was taken
prisoner with some others of his fellow townsmen and thrown into
a dungeon. The grumbling and bitterness of the majority during
that twelve months of captivity were very natural; but Francis,
unlike the rest, met the general discomfort with serene good-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>humour,
even merriment, so that not for the last time in his career
he was denounced as crazy.</p>

<p>On his release and return home, the merchant Bernadone
wished his son to cut some figure in the world; and when the
young man dreamed of shining armour and military glory, he
provided him with all he had asked in the way of clothes and
accoutrements and sent him in the train of a wealthy noble who
was going to fight in Naples.</p>

<p>Half-way on his journey Francis turned back to Assisi. God,
he believed, had told him to do so&mdash;why he could not tell. He
tried to follow the frivolous life he had led before, but now the
laughter of his companions seemed to ring hollow in his ears.
It was as if they found pleasure in a shadow, while he alone was
conscious that somewhere close was a reality of joy that, if he
could only discover it, would illumine the whole world.</p>

<p>Then his call came; but to the comfortable citizens of Assisi
it seemed the voice of madness. The young Bernadone, it was
rumoured, had been seen in the company of lepers and entertaining
beggars at his table. Almost all the money and goods he
possessed he had given away; nay, there came a final word that
he had sold his horse and left his home to live in a cave outside
the town. The people shook their heads at such folly and
sympathized with the old Bernadone at this end to his fine
ambitions for his son.</p>

<p>Pietro Bernadone in truth had developed such a furious anger
that he appealed to the Bishop of Assisi, entreating him either
to persuade Francis to give up his new way of life or else to
compel him to surrender the few belongings he had still left.
Francis was then summoned, and in the bishop’s presence
handed back to his father his purse and even his very clothes.
Penniless he stood before Assisi who had often ridden through
the streets a rich man’s heir, and it was a beggar’s grey robe
with a white cross roughly chalked upon it that he adopted as
the uniform of his new career.</p>

<p>His fellow townsmen had been moved by this complete
renunciation; but mingled at first with their admiration was a
half-scornful incredulity. They could understand saints ardent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
in defence of the Faith against heresy, fiery in their denunciation
of all worldly pleasures, for such belonged to the religious
atmosphere of the Middle Ages; but this son of Assisi, who
raised no banner in controversy, and found an equal joy of life in
the sunshine on a hill-side, in the warmth of a fire, in the squalor
of a slum, was at first beyond their spiritual vision.</p>

<p>Yet Francis Bernadone belonged as truly to the mediaeval
world as St. Dominic or St. Bernard of Clairvaux. In his spirit
was mingled the self-denial of the ‘Poor Men of Lyons’ and the
romance of the Provençal singers. These troubadours sang
of knights whose glory and boast were the life-service of some
incomparable lady. Francis exulted in his servitude to ‘My
Lady Poverty’, his soul aflame with a chivalry in contrast to
which the conventional devotion of poets burned dim.</p>

<p>In honour of ‘My Lady Poverty’ the rich merchant’s son had
cast away his father’s affection, his military ambitions, his
comfortable home and gay clothes; and because of the strength
and depth of his devotion the surrender left no bitterness, only
an intense joy that found beauty amid the rags, disease, and
filth of the most sordid surroundings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Franciscan Order</div>

<p>For some time it never occurred to Francis to found an Order
from amongst the men who, irresistibly drawn by his sincerity
and joy, wished to become his followers and share his privations
and work amongst the poor and sick. When they asked him for
a ‘rule of life’, such as that possessed by the monastic foundations,
he led them to the nearest church. In the words of a
chronicler:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Commencing to pray (because they were simple men and did
not know where to find the Gospel text relating to the renouncing
of the world), they asked the Lord devoutly that He would deign
to show them His will at the first opening of the Book.</p>

<p>‘When they had prayed, the blessed Francis, taking in his
hands the closed Book, kneeling before the Altar opened it, and
his eye fell first upon the precept of the Lord, “If thou wouldst
be perfect, sell all that thou hast and give to the poor and thou
shalt have treasure in Heaven”: at which the blessed Francis
was very glad and gave thanks to God.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, in dedication to the service of ‘My Lady Poverty’, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Order of the ‘Lesser Brethren’ (Minorites), or the ‘Poor Men
of Assisi’, was founded and received permission from Innocent III
to carry on its work amongst lepers and outcasts, though it was
not till 1223 that formal sanction for an Order was received
from Rome.</p>

<p>Three years later St. Francis died, and the Friars who had
lived with him declared that he had followed Christ so closely
that in his hands and feet were found the ‘stigmata’ or marks
of the wounds his Master had endured in the agony of crucifixion.
Tales have been handed down of his humility and gentleness,
of how, in the early days of the Order, he would go himself and
beg the daily bread for his small community rather than send
his companions to encounter possible insults; of how, in an age
that set little store even by human lives, he would rescue doves
in their cages that lads carried about for sale, and set them
free; and of how, because he read something of God’s soul in
every creature that had life, he preached to the birds as well as
to men.</p>

<p>Brotherhood to the friar of Assisi meant the union not only
of all human souls but of all creation in the praise of God, and
daily he offered thanks for the help of his brothers, the sun, the
fire, and the wind; and for his sisters, the moon and the water;
and for his mother, the earth. It was his love of nature, most
strange to the thirteenth century, that is one of the strongest
bonds between St. Francis and the men and women of to-day.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘He told the brother who made the garden’, says his chronicler,
‘not to devote all of it to vegetables, but to have some part for
flowering plants, which in their season produce “brother flowers”
for love of Him who is called “Flower of the Field” and “Lily
of the Valley”. He said, indeed, that Brother Gardener always
ought to make a beautiful patch in some part of the garden and
plant it with all sorts of sweet-smelling herbs, and herbs that
produce beautiful flowers, so that in their season they may invite
men, seeing them, to praise the Lord. For every creature cries
aloud, “God made me for thy sake, O Man!”’</p></blockquote>

<p>Once the true beauty of St. Francis’s life was recognized, his
followers increased rapidly and no longer had to fear insult or
injury when they begged. Crowds, indeed, collected to hear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
them preach and to bring them offerings. Some Franciscans
settled in France and Germany, and others went to England
during the reign of Henry III and lived amid the slums of
London, Oxford, and Norwich, wherever it seemed to them
that they could best serve ‘Lady Poverty’.</p>

<p>St. Francis himself before he died had been puzzled and
almost alarmed by the popularity he had never courted, and he
confessed sadly that, instead of living the lives of Saints, some
of those who professed to follow him were ‘fain to receive praise
and honour by rehearsing and preaching the works that the
Saints did themselves achieve’.</p>

<p>He was right in his fear for the future. Rules are a dead
letter without the spirit of understanding that gives them a true
obedience; and the secret of his joyous and unassuming self-denial
Francis could only bequeath to a few. Preaching, not
for the sake of helping man and glorifying God, but in order to
earn the wealth and esteem their founder had held as dross&mdash;this
was the temptation to which the ‘Grey Brethren’ succumbed,
even within the generation that had known St. Francis himself.
Avarice and self-satisfaction, following their wide popularity,
soon led the Franciscans into quarrels with the other religious
Orders and with the lecturers of the Universities and the
secular clergy. These looked upon the ‘Mendicants’ as interlopers,
trying to thieve congregations, fees, and revenues to
which they had no right.</p>

<p>‘None of the Faithful’, says a contemporary Benedictine
sourly, ‘believe they can be saved unless they are under the
direction of the Preachers or Minorites.’ The power of the
Franciscans, as of the Dominicans, was encouraged by the
majority of Popes, who, like Innocent III, recognized in their
enthusiasm a new weapon with which to defend Rome from
accusations of worldliness and corruption. In return for papal
sympathy and support the Friars became Rome’s most ardent
champions, and in defence of a system rather than in devotion to
an ideal of life they deteriorated and accepted the ordinary
religious standard of their day.</p>

<p>Once more a wave of reform had swept into the mediaeval<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
Church in a cleansing flood, only to be lost in the ebb tide of
reaction. Yet this ultimate failure did not mean that the force
of the wave was spent in vain. St. Francis could not stem the
corruption of the thirteenth century; but his simple sincerity
could reveal again to mankind an almost-forgotten truth that the
road to the love of God is the love of humanity.</p>

<p>‘The Benedictine Order was the retreat from the World, the
Franciscan the return to it.’ These words show that the
mediaeval mind, with its suspicion and dread of human nature,
was undergoing transformation. Already it showed a gleam
of that more modern spirit that traces something of the divine in
every work of God, and therefore does not feel distrust but
sympathy and interest.</p>

<p>To St. Augustine the way to the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Civitas Dei</i> had been a
precipitous and narrow road for each human soul, encompassed
by legions of evil in its struggle for salvation. To St. Francis
it was a pathway, steep indeed and rough, but bright with
flowers, and so lit by the joy of serving others that the pilgrim
scarce realized his feet were bleeding from the stones.</p>

<p>In the dungeons of Perugia the mirth of Francis Bernadone
had been called by his companions ‘craziness’, and to those
whose eyes read evil rather than good in this world his message
still borders on madness. Yet the Saint of Assisi has had his
followers in all ages since his death, distinguished not necessarily
by the Grey Friar’s robe, but by their silent spending of themselves
for others and their joyous belief in God and man.</p>

<span class="subhead">FRANCE UNDER TWO STRONG KINGS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>We have seen that Philip Augustus laid the foundations of
a strong French monarchy, but his death was followed by feudal
reaction, the nobles struggling in every way by fraud or violence
to recover the independence that they had lost.</p>

<p>Louis VIII, the new king, in order to checkmate their designs,
determined to divide his lands amongst his sons, all the younger
paying allegiance to the eldest, but each directly responsible
for the administration of his own province. Perhaps at the
time this was the most obvious means of ruling in the interests
of the crown a kingdom that, in its rapid absorption of
Normandy, Anjou, Poitou, and Toulouse, had outrun the
central government. Yet it was in truth a short-sighted policy
for, since these ‘appanages’, or royal fiefs, were hereditary,
they ended by replacing the old feudal nobility with a new, the
more arrogant in its ambitions because it could claim kinship
with the House of Capet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Louis IX</div>

<p>Louis VIII did not live long enough to put his plan into
execution; and Louis IX, a boy of twelve at the time of his
accession, though accepting later the provision made for his
younger brothers in his father’s will, was enabled, partly by the
administrative ability of his mother and guardian, Queen Blanche,
partly by his own personality, to maintain his supremacy undiminished.
On one occasion his brother, the Count of Anjou,
had imprisoned a knight, in anger that the man should have
dared to appeal to the king’s court against a judicial decision he
himself had given. ‘I will have but one king in France,’
exclaimed Louis when he heard, and ordered the knight to be
released and that both he and the count should bring their case
to Paris for royal judgement.</p>

<p>Heavy penalties were also inflicted by Louis on any promoters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
of private warfare, while the baronage was restricted in its
right to coin money. At this time eighty nobles besides the
King are said to have possessed their own mints. Louis, who
knew the feudal coinage was freely debased, forbade its circulation
except in the province where it had been minted; while his
own money, which was of far higher value, was made current
everywhere. Men and women naturally prefer good coins to
bad in exchange for merchandise; and so the King hoped that
the debased money, when restricted in use, would gradually be
driven out of existence.</p>

<p>If Louis believed in his rights as an absolute king, he had an
equally high conception of the duties that such rights involved.
‘Make thyself beloved by thy people,’ he said to his son, ‘for
I would rather that a Scotchman came from Scotland and
governed my subjects well and equitably than that thou shouldst
govern them badly.’</p>

<p>Royal justice, like the coinage, must be superior to any other
justice; and so the chroniclers tell us that Louis selected as his
bailiffs and seneschals those who were ‘loyal and wise, of upright
conduct and good reputation, above all, men with clean hands’.
Knowing the ease with which even well-meaning officials could
be corrupted by money and honours, he ordered his deputies
neither to receive nor give presents, while he warned his judges
always to lean rather to the side of the poor than of the rich in
a case of law until evidence revealed the truth.</p>

<p>Philip Augustus had followed justice because he believed that
it paid, and his subjects had feared and respected him. His
grandson, with his keen sense of honour, shrank from injustice as
something unclean; and we are told that the people ‘loved him
as men love God and the Saints’.</p>

<p>Like nearly all the kings of France, Louis was a devout son
of the Church, and it was under his protection that Innocent IV
resided safely at Lyons when Frederick II had driven him from
Rome.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> Nevertheless the King’s sincere love of the Faith,
that later won him canonization as a Saint, never hindered his
determination that he would be master of all his subjects,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
both lay and ecclesiastical. If the clergy sinned after the manner
of laymen he was firm that they should be tried in the lay courts;
and while his contemporary, Henry III of England, remained
a feeble victim of papal encroachments, Louis boldly declared,
‘It is unheard of that the Holy See, when it is in need, should
impose subsidies on the Church of France, and levy those contributions
on temporal goods that can only be imposed by the King.’</p>

<p>No storm of protest was aroused, for the Papacy in its bitter
struggle with the Empire was largely dependent on French
support; while Louis’s transparent purity of motive in maintaining
his supremacy disarmed indignation. An Italian friar, who
saw him humbly sharing the meal of some Franciscan brethren,
described him as ‘more monk than king’. This assumption was
at first sight borne out by his daily life: his simple diet and
love of sombre clothes; his habit of rising from his bed at
midnight and in the early mornings to share in the services of
the Church; his hatred of oaths, lying, and idle gossip; his
almost reckless charity; the eager help he offered in nursing
the sick amongst his Paris slums and in washing the feet of the
most repulsive beggars who crowded at his gate. ‘He was frail
and slender,’ says the same Italian, ‘with an angelic expression,
and dove’s eyes full of grace.’</p>

<p>Perhaps, if Louis had not been called to the life of a king, he
might have become a friar; but living in the world he loved his
wife and children, and would sometimes tease the former by
protesting, when she complained how poorly he dressed, that if
he put on gaudy clothes to please her she also must go in drab
attire to please him.</p>

<p>Those of his subjects who saw Louis on the battle-field
describe him as ‘the finest knight ever seen’, and recount
tales of their difficulty in restraining his hot courage, that would
carry him into the fiercest hand-to-hand conflict without any
thought of personal danger. Yet this king was a lover of
peace in his heart. He wished to be friends with all his Christian
neighbours, and, well content with the lands that already belonged
to the French crown, he negotiated a treaty by which he
recognized English claims to the Duchy of Guienne. Less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
successful was his effort to act as mediator between popes and
emperors; but if he could not secure peace he determined at
least to remain as neutral in the struggle as possible, refusing
the imperial crown when the Pope deposed Frederick II. Nor
would he reap advantage out of the anarchy that followed on that
emperor’s death.</p>

<p>War between Christians was hateful to Louis because it
prevented any combined action against the Turks; for in him, as
in Innocent III, burned the old crusading spirit that had never
quite died out in France.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the thirteenth century a French peasant
lad, Stephen, had preached a new crusade, saying that God had
told him in a vision that it was left for Christian children to
succeed where their elders had failed in recovering the Holy
Sepulchre. Thousands of boys and girls, some of them only
twelve or thirteen years of age, collected at Marseilles in eager
response to this message. They expected that a pathway would
be opened to them across the sea as in the days of Moses and
the Chosen People, and when they had waited for some time in
vain for this miracle, they allowed themselves to be entrapped by
false merchants, who, though Christian in name, would allow
nothing to stand in the way of the gold that they coveted.
Enticed on board ship, disarmed, bound, and manacled, the
unfortunate young crusaders were sold in the market-places of
Egypt and Syria to become the slaves of the Moslems whom
they had hoped to conquer.</p>

<p>When he had first heard of the Children’s Crusade,
Innocent III had exclaimed, ‘The children shame us indeed!’ and
St. Louis, the inheritor of their spirit, felt that his kingship would
be shamed unless he used his power and influence to convert
and overthrow the Turk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Seventh Crusade</div>

<p>One of his subjects, who loved him, the Sieur de Joinville,
has left a graphic personal account of the expedition undertaken
against Egypt. From Cyprus, the head-quarters of the crusaders,
a fleet of some one thousand eight hundred vessels, great and
small, sailed to Damietta, at the mouth of the Nile; and Louis,
seeing his ensign borne ashore, would not be restrained, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
leaped himself into the water, lance in hand, shouting his battle-cry
of ‘Mont-joie St. Denys!’</p>

<p>Before the impetuosity of an army inspired by this zeal the town
soon fell; but the mediaeval mind had reckoned little with difficulties
of climate, and soon the unhealthy mists that hung over
the delta of the Nile were decimating the Christian ranks with
fever and dysentery, while many of the best troops perished in
unimportant skirmishes into which daring rather than a wise
judgement had led them. The advance once checked became
a retreat, the retreat a rout; and St. Louis, refusing to desert
his rear-guard, was taken prisoner by the Mahometans.</p>

<p>The disaster was complete, for only on the surrender of
Damietta and the payment of a huge ransom was the King
released, but his patience and chivalry redeemed his failure
from all stain of ignominy. Instead of returning to France he
sailed to the Holy Land; where, though Jerusalem had again
fallen to the Turks after Frederick II’s temporary possession of
it, yet a strip of seaboard, including the port of Acre, remained
to the Christians.</p>

<p>Louis believed that, unless he persevered in fulfilling his vow,
crusaders of a lesser rank would lose their hope and courage, and
so, enfeebled by disease, he stayed for three years in Palestine,
until the death of his mother, Queen Blanche, whom he had left
as regent in France, compelled him to return home. Joinville
relates how on this voyage, because of the fierceness of the
storm, the sailors would have put the King ashore at Cyprus,
but Louis feared a panic amongst the terrified troops if he
agreed. ‘There is none’, he said, ‘that does not love his life
as much as I love mine, and these peradventure would never
return to their own land. Therefore I like better to place my
own person ... in God’s hands than to do this harm to the
many people who are here.’</p>

<p>Louis reached France in safety, but, chafing at his crusading
failures, he once more took the Cross, against the advice of his
barons, in 1270. It was his aim to regain Tunis, and so to free
part of North Africa at least from Mahometan rule. To this task
he brought his old religious enthusiasm, but France was weary of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
crusades, and many of those who had fought willingly in Syria
and Egypt now refused to follow him, leaving the greater part of
his army to be composed of mercenaries, tempted only by their pay.</p>

<p>Landing near Carthage, the crusaders soon found themselves
outnumbered, and were blockaded by their foes amid the ruins
of the town. Pestilence swept the crowded, insanitary camp,
and one of the first to fall a victim was the delicate king. ‘Lord,
have pity on Thy people whom I have led here. Send them to
their homes in safety. Let them not fall into the hands of their
enemies, nor let them be forced to deny Thy Holy Name.’</p>

<p>The dying words of the saint are characteristic of his love of
the Faith and of his people; and everywhere in the camp and
in France, when the news of his death reached her, there was
mourning for this king among kings who had sacrificed his life
for his ideals. Yet the flame of enthusiasm he had tried to keep
alight quickly flickered out into the darkness, and his son and
successor, Philip III, made a truce with the Sultan of Tunis that
enabled him to withdraw his army and embark for home. The
only person really annoyed by this arrangement was the English
prince Edward, afterwards Edward I, who arrived on the scene
just at the time of St. Louis’s death, thirsting for a campaign and
military glory; but owing to the general indifference he was
forced to give up the idea of war in Africa and continue his
journey alone to the Holy Land.</p>

<p>Philip III of France has left little mark on history. He
stands, with the title of ‘the Rash’, between two kings of dominant
personality&mdash;his father, canonized as a saint before the century
had closed, and his son Philip IV, ‘the Fair’, anything but
a saint in his hard, unscrupulous dealings with the world, but yet
one of the strongest rulers that France has known.</p>

<p>Philip IV was only seventeen when he became king. From
his nickname ‘le Bel’ it is obvious that he was handsome, but
no kindly Joinville has left a record of his personal life and
character. We can only draw our conclusions from his acts,
and these show him ruthless in his ambitions, mean, and
vindictive.</p>

<p>In his dealings with the Papacy Philip’s conduct stands contrasted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
with the usual affectionate reverence of his predecessors;
but this contrast is partly accounted for by the fact that, at the end
of the quarrel between Empire and Papacy, Rome found herself
regarding France from a very changed standpoint to the early
days of that encounter.</p>

<p>Ever since the time of Gregory VII the Hohenstaufen emperors
had loomed like a thunder-cloud on the papal horizon, but with the
execution of Conradin, the last of the royal line,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> this threatening
atmosphere had cleared. The Empire fell a prey to civil war
during the Great Interregnum, that is, during the seventeen
years when English, Spanish, and German princes contended
without any decisive results for the imperial crown. Count
Rudolf of Habsburg, who at last emerged triumphant, had
learned at least one diplomatic lesson, that if he wished to have
a free hand in Germany he could do so best as the friend of the
Pope, not as his enemy. One of his earliest acts was to ratify
a concordat with Rome in which he resigned all those imperial
claims to the lands belonging to the Holy See that Frederick II
had put forward. He also agreed to acknowledge Count
Charles of Anjou, brother of St. Louis and the Pope’s chief ally,
as Count of Provence and King of Naples and Sicily.</p>

<p>Italy was thus freed from German intervention, but her cities
remained torn by the factions of Guelfs and Ghibellines; and the
iron hand of the French lay as heavily on ‘The Kingdom’ as
ever the Hohenstaufen’s despotic sceptre. The Sicilians, restless
under the yoke, began to mourn Frederick, who, whatever
his sins, had been born and bred in the south, the son of
a southern princess; while these French were cruel with the
indifferent ferocity of strangers who despised those whom they
oppressed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sicilian Vespers</div>

<p>Out of the sullen hatred of the multitude, stirred of a sudden
to white heat by the assault of a French soldier on a woman of
Palermo, sprang the ‘Sicilian Vespers’, the rebellion and
massacre of an Easter Monday night, when more than four
thousand of the hated strangers, men, women, and children,
were put to death and their bodies flung into an open pit.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Charles of Anjou prepared a fitting revenge for this insult to his
race, a revenge that he intended to exact to the uttermost
farthing, for he had little of his brother’s sense of justice and
tender heart; but while he made his preparations a Spanish
prince, Peter III of Aragon, came to the rescue of the Sicilians
with a large fleet. A fierce war followed, but in spite of defeats,
treaties that would have sacrificed her to the interests of kings,
and continuous papal threats, Sicily clung staunch to her new
ally, gaining at last as a recognized Aragonese possession
a triumphant independence of the Angevin kingdom of Naples.</p>

<p>Rome, under a pope who was merely the puppet of Charles
of Anjou, had hurled anathemas at Peter III; but his successors
of more independent mind envied the Sicilians. It was of little
use for Rome to throw off Hohenstaufen chains if she must
rivet in their stead those of the French House of Anjou. This
was the fear that made her look with cold suspicion on her once
well-beloved sons the kings of France, whose relations of the
blood-royal were also kings of Naples.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Boniface VIII</div>

<p>In 1294 Pope Boniface VIII, sometimes called ‘the last of the
mediaeval Popes’ because any hopes of realizing the world-wide
ambitions of a Hildebrand or of an Innocent III died with him,
was elected to the Chair of St. Peter. His jubilee, held at
Rome in 1300 to celebrate the new century, was of a splendour
to dazzle the thousands of pilgrims from all parts of Europe
who poured their offerings into his coffers; but its glamour was
delusive.</p>

<p>Already he had suffered rebuffs in encounters with the kings
of England and France: for, when he published a Bull, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Clericis
Laicos</i>, that forbade the clergy to pay taxes any longer to
a lay ruler, Edward I at once condemned the English Church
to outlawry, until from fear of the wholesale robbery of their
lands and goods his bishops consented to a compromise that
made the Bull a dead letter. Philip IV of France, on his part,
was even more violent, for he retaliated by ordering his subjects
to send no more contributions to Rome of any kind.</p>

<p>A wiser man than Boniface might have realized from his
failures that the growth of nationality was proving too strong for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
any theories of world-government, whether papal or imperial;
but, old and stubborn, he could not set aside his Hildebrandine
ideals. When one of his legates, a Frenchman, embarked on
a dispute with Philip IV, Boniface told him to meet the King
with open defiance, upon which Philip immediately ordered the
ecclesiastic’s arrest, and that his archbishop should degrade
him from his office. Boniface then fulminated threats of
excommunication and deposition, to which the French king
replied by an act of open violence.</p>

<p>The agent he chose to inflict this insult was a certain Nogaret,
grandson of an Albigensian heretic who had been burned at the
stake, and this man joined himself to some of the nobles of the
Roman Campagna, who had equally little reverence for the Head
of Christendom. Heavily armed, they appeared in the village
of Anagni, where Boniface VIII was staying, and demanded to
see him. Outside in the street their men-at-arms stood shouting
‘Death to the Pope!’</p>

<p>Boniface could hear them from his audience-chamber, but
though he was eighty-six his courage did not fail him. Clad in
his full pontifical robes, his cross in one hand, his keys of St.
Peter in the other, he received the intruders. Nogaret roughly
demanded his abdication. ‘Here is my head! Here is my
neck!’ he replied. ‘Betrayed like Jesus Christ, if I must die
like Him I will at least die Pope.’ At this one of the Roman
nobles struck him across the face with his mailed glove, felling
him to the ground, and would have killed him had not Nogaret
interfered. It was the Provençal’s mission to intimidate rather
than to murder, and while he argued with the Italians a hostile
crowd assembled to rescue their Vicar, and the French agents
were forced to fly.</p>

<p>The proud old man survived the indignities he had suffered
only by a few weeks, and his successor, having dared to excommunicate
those who took part in the scene at Anagni, died also
with mysterious suddenness. No definite suspicion attached to
Philip IV, but rumour whispered the fatal word ‘poison’, and
the conclave of cardinals spent ten uneasy months in trying to
find a new pope. At last a choice emerged from the conclave,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
the Archbishop of Bordeaux, with the title of Clement V. He
was crowned at Lyons, and never ventured into Italy, choosing
as his residence the city of Avignon in Provence.</p>

<p>Here for just over seventy years, during the ‘Babylonish
Captivity’ as it was usually called, a succession of popes reigned
under French influence, having exchanged the imperial yoke
for one still more binding.</p>

<p>Philip IV at once made use of this French Head of Christendom
to condemn the Order of Templars, which from their
powerful organization and extensive revenues he had long
regarded with dislike and envy.</p>

<p>The crusades at an end, the Templars had outlived the object
of their foundation; while the self-denial imposed upon them
and their roving, uncloistered life, exposed them to constant
temptations to which many of the less spiritual succumbed.
Thus their suppression was probably wise; but Philip IV,
a pitiless enemy, did not merely suppress, he pursued the
Knights of the Temple with vindictive cruelty. Hundreds were
thrown into dungeons, and there tortured into confessing crimes,
the committal of which they afterwards recanted in vain; while
their principal officers were burned at the stake in the market-places
of the large French towns. By papal commands the
revenues of the Templars passed into the exchequer of the
Knights of St. John, who still guarded one of the outposts of
Christendom, the island of Rhodes; but the French king took
care that a substantial part of the money confiscated in France
went instead to his own treasury.</p>

<p>Philip was indeed in serious financial straits, for the revenues
of the royal demesnes were proving quite inadequate to meet the
expenses of a government that now extended its sway over the
length and breadth of France. Philip tried many expedients
to meet the deficiency, most of them bad. Such were the frequent
debasement of the coinage and the imposition of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gabelle</i>, that
is of a tax on the sale of goods. This was justly hated because
instead of encouraging commerce it penalized industry by adding
to the price of nearly every commodity put on the market.
Thus a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gabelle</i> imposed on grain would mean that a man must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
pay a tax on it three times over, first in the form of grain, then
of flour, and finally as bread.</p>

<p>Worse even than the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gabelle</i> was Philip’s method of ‘farming’
the taxes, that is, of selling the right to collect them to some
speculator, who would make himself responsible to the government
for a round sum, and then squeeze what extra money he
could out of the unfortunate populace in order to repay his
efforts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Government of Philip IV</div>

<p>It is not, then, for any improved financial administration that
the reign of Philip IV is worthy of praise. His was no original
genius, but rather a practical ability for developing the schemes
invented by his predecessors. Like them he hated and distrusted
his insubordinate baronage; and, seeking to impose his fierce
will upon them, turned for advice and obedience to men of lesser
rank, employing as the main instrument of his government the
lawyer class that Philip Augustus and Louis IX had introduced
in limited numbers amongst the feudal office-holders at their
court.</p>

<p>The employment of trained workers in the place of amateurs
resulted in improved administration, so it followed that under
Philip IV the French government began to take a definitely
modern stamp and became divided into separate departments
for considering different kinds of work. Thus it was the duty
of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Conseil du Roi</i>, or King’s Council, to give the Sovereign
advice; of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Chambre des Comptes</i>, or Chamber of Finance,
to deal with financial questions; of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Parlement</i>, or chief
judicial court, to sit in Paris for two months at least twice a year
to hold assizes and give judgements.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Parlement de Paris</i> resembles the English Parliament
somewhat in name; but except for a right, later acquired, of
registering royal edicts, its work was entirely judicial, not legislative.
The body in France that most nearly corresponded to
the English Parliament was the ‘States-General’, composed of
representatives of the three ‘Estates’ or classes, of clergy, nobles,
and citizens. The peasants of France, who composed the
greater part of her population, were not represented at all.</p>

<p>Philip IV summoned the ‘States-General’ several times to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
approve his suggestions; but, unlike the ‘Model Parliament’
called by his English contemporary Edward I for similar reasons,
it never developed into a legislative assembly that could act
as a competent check upon royal tyranny, but existed merely
as it seemed to accept responsibility for its ruler’s laws and
financial demands, whether good or bad. Its weakness arose
partly from the fact that it often sat only for a day at a time and
so had no leisure to discuss the measures laid before it, but still
more owing to the class selfishness that prevented the three
classes from combining to insist on reforms before they would
vote any taxes.</p>

<p>This was very unfortunate for France, since on the one occasion
that the nobles and burghers actually did combine in refusing
to submit to an especially obnoxious <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gabelle</i> that hit both their
pockets, Philip IV was forced to yield, reluctantly enough because
the loss of the money led to his failure in a war in Flanders.</p>

<p>Flanders was a fief of the French crown, and because its
count, his tenant-in-chief, had dared to rebel against him, Philip
had flung him into prison and declared his lands confiscated.
Then with his queen he had ridden north to visit this territory
now owning direct allegiance to himself, in the belief that he had
nothing to do but to give orders to its inhabitants and await their
immediate fulfilment. The chroniclers tell us that the royal
pair were overcome with astonishment at the display of fine
clothes and jewels made by the burghers of Bruges to do them
honour.</p>

<p>‘I thought that there was only one Queen in France,’
exclaimed Philip’s consort discontentedly. ‘Here I see at least
six hundred.’ The King, always with an eye to the main
chance, regarded the brilliant throng more philosophically.
They seemed to him very suitable subjects for taxation; but
the Flemings had won their wealth by a sturdy independence
of spirit both in the market-place and on the high seas: they
had been indifferent to the fate of their count, but at any time
preferred the risks of rebellion to being plucked like geese by the
King of France.</p>

<p>On the field of Courtrai, where Philip brought his army to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
punish their insolence, the Flemish burghers taught Europe, as
their Milanese fellows had at Legnano in the twelfth century,
that citizen levies could hold their own against heavily-armed
feudal troops; and though the King’s careful generalship redeemed
this defeat two years later, he found the victory he obtained barren
of fruit. Within a few weeks of the burghers’ apparent collapse
yet another citizen army had rallied to attack the royal camp,
and Philip, declaring angrily that ‘it rained Flemings’, was
driven to conclude a peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Philip IV</div>

<p>Besides hating the independence of the Flemings, Philip IV
grudged the English supremacy over the Duchy of Guienne that
his grandfather had so willingly acknowledged. To his jealous
eyes it ran its wedge like an alien dagger into the heart of his
kingdom; and watching his opportunity until Edward I was
involved in wars with Wales and Scotland, Philip crossed the
borders of the Duchy, and by force or craft obtained control of
the greater number of its fortresses. There is little doubt that
had he lived he would gradually have absorbed the whole of the
southern provinces; but when only forty-six he died, mourned
by few of his subjects, and yet one of the kings who had set his
stamp with the most lasting results upon the government of
France.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE HUNDRED YEARS’ WAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p>During fourteen years, from 1314 to 1328, three sons of Philip
IV reigned in rapid succession; but with the death of the last
the main line of the House of Capet came to an end, and the
crown passed to his nephew and namesake Philip of Valois.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
The latter declared that his claims were based on a clause of
the old Salic Law<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> forbidding a woman to inherit landed
property, because as it happened Philip IV had left a daughter
Isabel, who had married Edward II of England, and their son
Edward III loudly protested that his right to the throne of
France was stronger than that of the Valois. The Salic Law,
Edward maintained, might prevent a woman from succeeding
to the throne, but there was nothing in this restriction to forbid
the inheritance passing to her male heirs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of the Hundred Years’ War</div>

<p>The question of the Salic Law is important because its
different interpretations were the immediate excuse for opening
hostilities between England and France in that long and weary
struggle called the ‘Hundred Years’ War’. There were of
course other and far deeper reasons. One of these reasons
was that English kings had never forgotten or forgiven John’s
expulsion from Normandy. They wanted to avenge this ignominious
defeat and also Philip IV’s encroachments in the Duchy
of Guienne, that, united to his policy of supporting the Scottish
chieftains in their war of independence, had been a steady
source of disaster to England since the beginning of the fourteenth
century.</p>

<p>Because of his failure in Scotland and the revolts of his
turbulent barons Edward II was murdered; and Edward III,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
taking warning from his father’s fate, welcomed the war with
France, not merely in the hope of revenge and glory, but still
more in order to find an occupation for the hot English blood
that might otherwise in the course of its embittered feuds
murder him.</p>

<p>He rode forth to battle, the hero of his court and of the
chivalry of England; but no less, as it happened, the champion
of her middle classes, who cheerfully put their hands in their
pockets to pay for his first campaigns. The reason of their
enthusiasm for this war was that Philip of Valois, in order
to annoy his rival, had commanded his Flemish subjects to
trade no longer with the English. Now English sheep were
the best in Europe (so valuable that their export was forbidden
lest another nation should obtain the breed), and English wool
was the raw material of all others on which Flanders depended
for the wealth and prosperity gained by her looms and factories.
Before this time English kings had encouraged Flemish trade,
establishing ‘Staple’ markets in certain towns under their
protection, where merchants of both countries could meet and
bargain over their wares. Wishing to retaliate on Philip VI,
however, Edward III stopped the export of wool, though at
the same time he offered good terms and advantages to any
of the manufacturers of Bruges and Ghent who might care to
settle in Norfolk or on the East Coast and set up factories there
as English subjects.</p>

<p>Such a suggestion could not satisfy the Flemish national
spirit, and in the large towns discontent with the French king
grew daily. At last one of the popular leaders, Jacob van
Artevelde, ‘the Brewer of Ghent’, began to rouse his countrymen
by inflammatory speeches. ‘He showed them’, says the
chronicler, ‘that they could not live without the King of England’;
and his many commercial arguments he strengthened
with others intended to win those who might hesitate to break
their oath of allegiance, assuring them that Edward III was
in truth by right of birth King of France.</p>

<p>Rebellion sprang up on all sides in response; and when,
in 1338, Edward III actually embarked on the war, he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
behind him not only the English wool-farmers, but also the
majority of Flemish merchants and artisans, alike convinced
that his victory would open Flemish markets to trade across
the Channel.</p>

<p>The Hundred Years’ War falls into two distinct periods:
the first, the contest waged by the Angevin Edward III against
the House of Valois, a struggle that lasted until 1375; the
second, a similar effort begun by the Lancastrian Kings of
England in 1415 after a time of almost suspended hostilities
under Richard II. In each period there is the same switchback
course to the campaigns, as they rise towards a high-water mark
of English successes only to sink away to final French
achievement.</p>

<p>The first of the great English victories was fittingly a naval
battle, destined to avenge long years during which French
raiders had harried the south coast, penetrated up the Solent,
and even set fire to large towns like Southampton. In June
1340, near the entrance to the port of Sluys, some two hundred
English vessels of all makes and sizes came upon the French
fleet, drawn up in four lines closely chained together so as to
form a kind of bulwark to the harbour. On the decks of the
tall ships, the turrets of which were piled with stones and other
missiles, were hundreds of Genoese archers; but the English
bowmen at this time had no match in Europe for long-distance
accuracy and steadiness, and the whistling fire of their arrows
soon drove their hired rivals into hiding and enabled the
English men-at-arms to board the vessels opposite them almost
unopposed.</p>

<p>From this moment panic set in along the French lines, and
the greater number of ships, unable to escape because of the
chains that bound them together, were sunk at anchor, with,
according to the chroniclers, twenty-five thousand of their crews
and fighting-material.</p>

<p>The English were now masters of the Channel, and Edward
III was enabled to transplant an army to Flanders, but no
triumph in any way corresponding to the victory of Sluys
rewarded his efforts in this field of warfare. The campaign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
became a tedious affair of sieges; and the Flemings, cooling
from their first sympathies, came to dislike the English and
to accuse Jacob van Artevelde of supplying Edward III with
money, merely in order to forward his personal ambitions.
This charge the Flemish leader stoutly denied, but when,
hearing the people of Ghent hooting him in the street outside
his house, he stepped out on to the balcony and tried to clear
himself, the mob surged forward, and, refusing to listen to a
word, broke in through the barred doors and murdered him.
This was ill news for Edward III, but angry though he was
at the fate of his ally, he had neither sufficient men nor money
to exact vengeance. Instead he himself determined to try
a new theatre of war, for, as well as his army in Flanders,
he had other forces fighting the French in Normandy and
Guienne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Creci</div>

<p>Edward landed in Normandy; and at Creci, to the north of
the Somme, as he marched towards Calais, he was overtaken
by Philip of Valois in command of a very large but undisciplined
force.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘You must know’, says Froissart, the famous chronicler of
this first period of the Hundred Years’ War, ‘that the French
troops did not advance in any particular order, and that as soon
as their King came in sight of the English his blood began to
boil, and he cried out to his Marshals, “Order the Genoese
forward and begin the battle in the name of God and St. Denys!”’</p></blockquote>

<p>These Genoese were archers, who had already marched on
foot so far and at such a pace that they were exhausted; and
when, against their will, they sullenly advanced, their bows that
were wet from a thunderstorm proved slack and untrue. The
sun also, that had just emerged from behind a cloud, shone in
their eyes and dazzled them. Silently the English bowmen
waited as they drew near, shouting hoarsely, and then of a
sudden poured into the weary ranks such a multitude of arrows
that ‘it seemed as though it snowed’.</p>

<p>The Genoese, utterly disheartened, broke and fled; at which
the French king, choking with rage, cried, ‘Kill me this rabble
that cumbers our road without any reason’; but the English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
fire never ceased; and the French knights and men-at-arms
that came to take the place of the Genoese and rode them
underfoot fell in their turn with the shafts piercing through the
joints of their heavy armour.</p>

<p>Again, at Creci it was made evident to Europe that the old
feudal order of battle was passing away. Victory fell not to
the knight armoured with his horse like a slowly-moving turret,
but to the clear-eyed, leather-clad bowman, or the foot-soldier
quick with his knife or spear. The French fought gallantly
at Creci, and none more fiercely than Philip of Valois, whose
horse was killed beneath him; but courage cannot wipe out
bad generalship, and when at last he consented to retreat he
left eleven princes of the blood-royal and over a thousand of
his knights stretched on the battle-field.</p>

<p>The defeat of Creci took from Calais any hope of French
succour, and in the following year after a prolonged siege it
surrendered to the English and became the most cherished of
all their possessions across the seas. ‘The Commons of
England’, wrote Froissart, ‘love Calais more than any town
in the world, for they say that as long as they are masters of
Calais they hold the keys of France at their girdle.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Black Death</div>

<p>Death at the battle of Creci, decked in all the panoply of
mediaeval warfare, had taken its toll of the chivalry of France and
England. Now, in an open and ghastly form, indifferent alike to
race or creed, it stalked across Europe, visiting palace and castle
but sweeping with a still more ruthless scythe the slum and the
hovel. Somewhere in the far East the ‘Black Death’, as it was
later called, had its origin, and wherever it passed, moving
westward, villages, nay, even towns, disappeared.</p>

<p>More than thirteen million people are said to have perished
in China, India was almost depopulated, and at last in 1347
Europe also was smitten. Very swift was the blow, for many
victims of the plague died in a few hours, the majority within
five days; and contemporary writers tell us of ships, that left
an eastern harbour with their full complement of crew, found
drifting in the Mediterranean a few weeks later without a
living soul on board to take the helm; of towns where the dead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
were so many that there was none to bury them; of villages
where the peasants fell like cattle in the fields and by the
wayside unnoticed.</p>

<p>In Italy, in France, in England, there is the same record of
misery and terror. Boccaccio, the Italian writer, describes in
his book, the <cite>Decameron</cite>, how the wealthy nobles and maidens
of Florence fled from the plague-stricken town to a villa without
the walls, there to pass their days in telling one another tales.
These tales have made Boccaccio famous as the first great
European novelist; but in reality not many even of the wealthy
could keep beyond the range of infection, and Boccaccio himself
says elsewhere ‘these who first set the example of forsaking
others languished where there was no one to take pity on them’.</p>

<p>Neither courage, nor devotion, nor selfishness could avail
against the dread scourge; though like all diseases its ravages
were most virulent where small dwellings were crowded together
or where dirt and insanitary conditions prevailed. ‘They fell
sick by thousands,’ says Boccaccio of the poorer classes, ‘and
having no one whatever to attend them, most of them died.’
According to a doctor in the south of France, ‘the number of
those swept away was greater than those left alive.’ In the once
thriving port of Marseilles ‘so many died that it remained like
an uninhabited place’. Another French writer, speaking of
Paris, says, ‘there was so great a mortality of people of both
sexes ... that they could hardly be buried.’ ‘There was no city,
nor town, nor hamlet,’ writes an Englishman of his own country,
‘nor even, save in rare instances, any house, in which this plague
did not carry off the whole or the greater portion of the
inhabitants.’</p>

<p>One immediate result of the Black Death was to put a
temporary stop to the war between England and France; for
armies were reduced to a fraction of their former strength and
rival kings forgot words like ‘glory’ or ‘conquest’ in terrified
contemplation of an enemy against whom all their weapons were
powerless.</p>

<p>Other and more lasting effects were experienced everywhere,
for town and village life was completely disorganized: magistrates,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
city officials, priests, and doctors had perished in such
numbers that it was difficult to replace them: criminals plundered
deserted houses unchecked: the usually law-abiding, deprived
of the guidance to which they had been accustomed, gave themselves
up to a dissolute life, trying to drown all thoughts of the
past and future in any enjoyment they could find in the present.
Work almost ceased: the looms stood idle, the ships remained
without cargoes, the fields were neither reaped of the one harvest
nor sown for the next. The peasants, when reproached, declared
that the plague had been a sign of the end of the world and that
therefore to labour was a waste of time. ‘All things were
dearer,’ says a Frenchman: ‘furniture, food, and merchandise of
all sorts doubled in price: servants would only work for higher
wages.’</p>

<p>In the years following the Black Death the labouring classes
of Europe discovered for the first time their value. They were
the necessary foundation to the scheme of mediaeval life, the
base of the feudal pyramid; and, since they were now few in
number, masters began to compete for their services. Thus they
were able to demand a better wage for their work and improved
conditions; but here the governments of the day, that ruled in
the interests of the nobles and middle classes, stepped in, forbade
wages to be raised, or villeins and serfs to leave their homes and
seek better terms in another neighbourhood. The discontent of
those held down with an iron hand, yet half awake to the possibilities
of greater freedom, seethed towards revolution; but few
mediaeval kings chose to look below the surface of national life,
and in the case of England Edward III was certainly not enough
of a statesman to do so.</p>

<p>In 1355 he renewed the war with France, hoping that by
victories he would be able to fill his own purse from French
ransoms and pillage as well as to drug the disordered popular
mind at home with showy triumphs. His eldest son, Edward,
the Black Prince, who had gained his spurs at Creci, landed at
Bordeaux and marched through Guienne, the English armies
like the French being mainly composed of ‘companies’, that is,
of hired troops under military captains, the terror of friends and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
foes alike; for with impartial ruthlessness they trampled down
corn and vineyards as they passed, pillaged towns, and burned
farms and villages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Poitiers</div>

<p>Philip of Valois was dead, but his son, John ‘the Good’, had
succeeded him, and earned his title, it must be supposed, by his
punctilious regard for the laws of mediaeval chivalry. His
reckless daring, extravagance, and rash generalship made him
at any rate a very bad ruler according to modern standards.
Froissart says that on the field of Poitiers, where the two armies
met, ‘King John on his part proved himself a good knight;
indeed, if the fourth of his people had behaved as well, the day
would have been his own.’</p>

<p>This is extremely doubtful, for the French, though far the
larger force, were outmanœuvred from the first. The Black
Prince had the gift of generalship and disposed his army so that
it was hidden amid the slopes of a thick vineyard, laying an
ambush of skilled archers behind the shelter of a hedge. As
King John’s cavalry charged towards the only gap, in order to
clear a road for their main army, they were mown down by a
merciless fire at short range from the ambush; while in the ensuing
confusion English knights swept round on the French
flank and put the foot-soldiers to flight. The Black Prince’s
victory was complete, for King John and his principal nobles
were surrounded and taken prisoners after a fierce conflict in
which for a long time they refused to surrender. ‘They behaved
themselves so loyally’, says Froissart, ‘that their heirs to this day
are honoured for their sake’: and Prince Edward, waiting on
his royal captive that night at dinner, awarded him the ‘prize
and garland’ of gallantry above all other combatants.</p>

<p>Evil days followed in France, where her king’s chivalry
could not pay his enormous ransom nor those of his distinguished
fellow prisoners. For this money merchants must sweat and
save, and the peasants toil longer hours on starvation rations;
while the ‘companies’, absolved by a truce from regular warfare,
exacted their daily bread at the sword-point when and
where they chose.</p>

<p>Famous captains, who were really infamous brigands, took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
their toll of sheep and corn and grapes; and those farmers and
labourers who refused, or could not give what they required, they
flung alive on to bonfires, while they tortured and mutilated
their wives and families. Against such wickedness there was no
protection either from the government or overlords; indeed, the
latter were as cruel as the brigand chiefs, extorting the very
means of livelihood from their tenants and serfs to pay for the
distractions of a court never more extravagant and pleasure-seeking
than in this hour of national disaster.</p>

<p>‘Jacques Bonhomme,’ the French noble would say mockingly
of the peasant, ‘has a broad back ... he will pull out his purse
fast enough if he is beaten.’ The day came, however, when
Jacques Bonhomme, grown reckless in his misery, pulled out his
knife instead, and, in the words of Froissart, became like a ‘mad
dog’. He had neither leaders nor any hope of reform, nothing
but a seething desire for revenge; and in the ‘Jacquerie’, as the
peasant rebellion of this date was called, he inflicted on the
nobles and their families all the horrors that he himself, standing
by helpless, had seen perpetrated on his own belongings.
Castles were burned, their furniture and treasures looted and
destroyed, their owners were roasted at slow fires, their wives
and daughters violated, their children tortured and massacred.</p>

<p>This is one of the most hideous scenes in French history, the
darker because France in her blindness learned no lesson from
it. The nobles, who soon gained the upper hand against these
wild undisciplined hordes, exacted a vengeance in proportion to
the crimes committed, and fixed the yoke of serfdom more surely
than ever on the shoulders of Jacques Bonhomme. This was
the only way, in their conception, to deal with such a mad dog;
but Jacques Bonhomme was in reality an outraged human being
of flesh and blood like those who loathed and despised him;
and during centuries of tyranny his anger grew in force and
bitterness until in the Revolution of 1789 it burst forth with
a violence against both guilty and innocent that no power in
France was strong enough to stem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Étienne Marcel</div>

<p>The outrages of the Jacquerie unfortunately discredited real
efforts at reform that had been initiated in Paris by the leader<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
of the middle classes, the Provost of Merchants, Étienne Marcel.
This Marcel had demanded that the States-General should be
called regularly twice a year, that the Dauphin Charles,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> eldest
son of King John, who was acting as regent during his father’s
imprisonment, should send away his favourites, and that instead
of these fraudulent ministers a standing council of elected
representatives should be set up to advise the crown.</p>

<p>To these and many other reforms the Dauphin pretended to
yield under the pressure of public opinion; but he soon broke
all his promises and began to rule again as he chose. Marcel,
roused to indignation, summoned his citizen levies, and, breaking
into the Prince’s palace, ordered his men-at-arms to seize two
of the most hated ministers and drag them to the royal presence.
‘Do that quickly for which you were brought,’ he said to the
soldiers; whereupon they slew the favourites as they crouched
at Charles’s feet, their fingers clinging to his robe.</p>

<p>This act of violence won for Étienne Marcel the undying
hatred of the Dauphin and his court, and from this time the
decline of his influence may be traced. In order to maintain
his power the popular leader was driven to condone the excesses
of the peasants, in their rebellion, that had shocked the whole
of France, and to ally himself with Charles the Bad, King of
Navarre, to whom he promised to deliver the keys of Paris in
return for his support against the Dauphin.</p>

<p>This was a fatal move, for Charles the Bad did not care at all
for the interests of the middle classes: he only wished to gain
some secret or advantage worth selling, and at once betrayed
Étienne to his foes as soon as the Dauphin paid him a sufficient
price. Then a trap was arranged, and Marcel killed in the
gateway of Paris as he was about to open its strong bars to his
treacherous ally. With his death all attempts at securing
a more liberal and responsible government failed.</p>

<p>The country, indeed, had sunk into the apathy of exhaustion;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
and two years later the Treaty of Bretigni, that represents the
high-water mark of English power in France, was thankfully
signed. In return for Edward III’s surrender of his claim to
the French throne, his right to the Duchy of Guienne as well as
to Calais and the country immediately round its walls was
recognized, without any of the feudal obligations that had been
such a fruitful source of trouble in old days.</p>

  <div class="caption">The Treaty of BRETIGNI</div></div>

<p>Peace now seemed possible for an indefinite period; but, in
truth, so long as two hostile nations divided France there was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
always the likelihood of fresh discord; and the Dauphin, who
had succeeded his father, King John, gently fanned the flames
whenever he thought that the political wind blew to his advantage.
From a timid, peevish youth, one of the first to fly in terror from
the field of Poitiers, he had developed into an astute politician,
whose successful efforts to regain the lost territories of France
earned him the title of ‘Wise’.</p>

<p>King Edward III and his son professed to despise this prince,
who knew not how to wield a lance to any purpose; but Charles,
though feeble in body and a student rather than a soldier at
heart, knew how to choose good captains to serve him in the
field; and one of these&mdash;the famous Bertrand du Guesclin, said
to have been the ugliest knight and best fighter of his time&mdash;became
the hero of many a battle against the English, first of
all in France, and later in Spain.</p>

<p>It was owing to the war in Spain that the English hold over
the south of France was first shaken; for the Black Prince, who
had been created Duke of Guienne, unwisely listened to the
exiled King of Castile, Pedro the Cruel, who came to Bordeaux
begging his assistance against the usurper of his throne. This
was his illegitimate brother, Henry of Trastamara. The English
Prince at once declared that chivalry demanded that he should
help the rightful king. Perhaps he remembered the strong
bond that there had been between England and Castile ever
since his great-grandfather, Edward I, had married the Spanish
Eleanor: perhaps it was the promise of large sums of money
that Pedro declared would reward the victorious troops: it is
more likely, however, that the fiery soldier was moved by the news
that Henry of Trastamara had gained his throne through French
assistance and by the deeds of arms of the renowned Du
Guesclin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Navarette</div>

<p>In 1367 the English Prince crossed the Pyrenees, and at
Navarette, near the river Ebro, his English archers and good
generalship proved a match once more for his foes. Although
the Spaniards were in vastly superior numbers they were mown
down as they rashly charged to the attack; and Henry of
Trastamara was driven from the field, leaving Du Guesclin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
a prisoner and his brother Pedro once more able to assert his
kingship.</p>

<p>The real victors of Navarette now had cause to repent their
alliance. Sickness, due to the heat of the climate and strange
food, had thinned their ranks even more than the actual warfare:
the money promised by Pedro the Cruel was not forthcoming;
indeed, that wily scoundrel, after atrocities committed against
his helpless prisoners that fully bore out his nickname, had
slipped away to secure his throne, while the Black Prince was
in no position to pursue him, and could gain little satisfaction
by correspondence. Sullen and weary, with the fever already
lowering his vitality that was finally to cut short his life, Edward of
Wales arrived in Bordeaux with his almost starving ‘companies’.
Because he had no money to pay them, he set them free to
ravage southern France, while in order to fill his exchequer he
imposed a tax on every hearth in Guienne.</p>

<p>These measures proved him no statesman, whatever his
generalship. In the early days of the Hundred Years’ War
Guienne had looked coldly on Paris, and appreciated a distant
ruler who secured her liberty of action; now, victim of a policy
of mingled pillage and exactions, she soon came to regard her
English rulers as foreign tyrants. Thus an appeal was made
by the men of Guienne to Charles V, and he, in defiance of the
terms of the Treaty of Bretigni, summoned Prince Edward to
Paris&mdash;as though he were his vassal&mdash;to answer the charges
made against him. ‘Gladly we will answer our summons,’
replied the Prince, when he heard. ‘We will go as the King
of France has ordered us, but with helm on head and sixty
thousand men.’</p>

<p>They were bold words; but the haughty spirit that dictated
them spoke from the mouth of a dying man, and the Black
Prince never lived to fulfil his boast. His place in France was
taken by his younger brother, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster,
who proved himself an indifferent general. In 1373 Duke John
marched from Calais into the heart of France, his army burning
villages as it went; but though he pressed deeper and ever
deeper into the enemy’s country, he met no open foes nor towns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
that he could take without a siege. ‘Let them be,’ said Charles
‘the Wise’, when his indignant nobles pleaded for leave to fight
a pitched battle; ‘by burnings they shall not seize our heritage.
Though a storm and tempest rage together over a land they
disperse themselves: so will it be with these English.’</p>

<p>Ever since the Treaty of Bretigni Charles had been planning
profitable alliances with foreign rulers that would leave the
English friendless; while, like Henry the Fowler of Germany,
he had fortified his cities against invasion. With the advent of
winter Lancaster and his men could find no food nor succour
from any local barons; and when at last the remnant of his once
proud army reached Bordeaux, it was without a single horse,
and leaving a track of sick and dying to be cut off by guerrilla
bands. He had not lost a single battle, but he was none the less
defeated, and had imperilled the English cause in France.</p>

<p>The truce of 1375 that practically closed the first period of
the Hundred Years’ War left to Edward III and his successors
no more than the coast towns of Calais, Cherbourg, Brest,
Bayonne, and Bordeaux.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<div class="sidenote">Henry V in France</div>

<p>When in 1415 Henry V of England formally claimed the
throne of France, and by so doing renewed the war that had
languished since 1375, he had no satisfactory argument save his
sword to uphold his demands. Grandson of John of Gaunt, and
son of the royal usurper Henry IV, who had deposed and killed
his cousin Richard II, Henry V hoped by a successful campaign
to establish the popularity of the Lancastrian dynasty. He
wished also, like most mediaeval rulers, to find a battle-ground
for his barons in any territory except his own. It is only fair
to add that of the modern belief that the one possible excuse
for shedding human blood is a righteous cause he had not the
faintest conception.</p>

<p>‘War for war’s sake’ might have been the motto of this most
mediaeval of all English sovereigns; but if his purpose is indefensible
to-day in its selfish callousness, he at any rate chose an
admirable time in which to put it into execution; for France, that
had begun to recover a semblance of nationality under the rule<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
of Charles ‘the Wise’, had degenerated into anarchy under his
son Charles ‘the Mad’.</p>

<p>First as a minor, for he was only eleven at the time of his
accession, and later when he developed frequent attacks of insanity,
Charles VI was destined to be some one else’s tool, while
round his person raged those factions for which Louis VIII had
shortsightedly prepared when he set the example of creating
appanages.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> First one ‘Prince of the Lilies’ and then another
strove to control the court and government in their own interests;
but the most formidable rivals at the beginning of the
fifteenth century were the Houses of Burgundy and Armagnac.</p>

<p>The latter centred in the person of the young Charles, Duke
of Orleans, the King’s nephew and a son-in-law of Count
Bernard of Armagnac, who gave his name to the party: the
other was his cousin, John ‘the Fearless’, Duke of Burgundy, who
was also by inheritance from his mother Count of Flanders, and
therefore ruler of that great middle province lying between
France and the Empire.</p>

<p>The King himself in his moments of sanity inclined to the side
of Charles of Orleans and the Armagnacs; and it happened that
just at the time when Henry V of England landed in Normandy
and laid siege to Harfleur the Armagnacs controlled Paris. It
was their faction therefore that raised an army and sent it northwards
to oppose the invaders, while John of Burgundy stood
aloof, for besides being unwilling to help the Armagnacs he was
reluctant to embroil himself in a war with England, on whose wool
trade the commercial fortunes of his Flemish towns depended.</p>

<p>At Agincourt Henry V, who had taken Harfleur and was
marching towards Calais, came upon his foes drawn up across
the road that he must follow in such vastly superior numbers
that they seemed overwhelming. The battle that followed, however,
showed that the French had learned no military lesson
from previous disasters. The heavily-armed, undisciplined noble
on horseback was still their main hope, and on this dark
October day he floundered helplessly in the mud, unable to
charge, scarcely able to extricate himself, an easy victim for his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
enemy’s shafts. The slaughter was tremendous; for Henry,
receiving a false report that a new French army was appearing
on the horizon, commanded his prisoners to be killed, and
numbers had perished before the mistake was discovered and
the order could be reversed.</p>

<p>When the news of the defeat and massacre at Agincourt
reached Paris, that had always hated the Armagnacs, the
indignant populace broke into rebellion, crying, ‘Burgundy and
Peace!’ but the movement was suppressed, and it was not till
1418 that John ‘the Fearless’ succeeded in entering the capital.
By this time Henry V, who had returned to England after his
victory, was once more back in France conquering Normandy;
and French indignation was roused to white heat when it was
known that Rouen, the old capital of the Duchy, had been forced
to surrender to his victorious arms.</p>

<p>Even the Duke of Burgundy, who still disliked war with
England, felt that he must take some steps to prevent further
encroachments; and, after negotiations with the enemy had failed
owing to their arrogant demands, he suggested an agreement
with the Armagnacs, in order that France, if she must fight,
should at least present a united front to her foes.</p>

<p>Here was the moment for France’s regeneration; for the
head of the Armagnac faction at this date was the Dauphin
Charles, son of Charles ‘the Mad’, and in response to his rival’s
olive branch he consented to meet him on the bridge of
Montereau in order that the old rift might be cemented. In token
of submission and goodwill John of Burgundy knelt to kiss the
Prince’s hand; but, as he did so, an Armagnac still burning
with party hate sprang forward and plunged his dagger into his
side. A shout of horror and rage arose from the Burgundians,
and as they carried away the body of John ‘the Fearless’ they
swore that this murder had been arranged from the beginning and
that they would never pay allegiance again to the false Dauphin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Treaty of Troyes</div>

<p>In the Treaty of Troyes that was forthwith negotiated with the
English they ratified this vow, for Henry V of England received
the hand of the mad king’s daughter Catherine in marriage and
was recognized as his heir to the throne of France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
Two years later died both Henry V and Charles VI, leaving
France divided into two camps, one lying mainly in the north
and east, that acknowledged as ruler the infant Henry VI, son of
Henry V and Catherine; the other in the south and south-west,
that obeyed the Valois Charles VII.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Troyes marks the high-water mark of English
power in France during the second period of the Hundred Years’
War; for, though the banners that Henry V had carried
so triumphantly at Agincourt were pushed steadily southward
into Armagnac territory after this date, yet the influence of
the invaders was already on the wane. The agreement that
gave France to a foreigner and a national enemy had been made
only with a section of the French nation; and some of those
who in the heat of their anger against the Armagnacs had
consented to its terms were soon secretly ashamed of their
strange allegiance.</p>

<p>When Charles the Dauphin became Charles VII he ceased to
appear merely the leader of a party discredited by its murder
of the Duke of Burgundy. He became a national figure; and
though his enemies might call him in derision ‘King of Bourges’
because he dared not come to Paris but ruled only from
a town in central France, yet he remained in spite of all their
ridicule a king and a Frenchman. Had he been less timid and
selfish, more ready to run risks and exert himself rather than to
idle away his time with unworthy favourites, there is no doubt
that he could have hastened the English collapse. Instead he
allowed those who fostered his indolence and hatred of public
affairs in order to increase their own power to hinder a reconciliation
with the Burgundians that might have been the
salvation of France.</p>

<p>Philip ‘the Good’, son of John ‘the Fearless’, disliked the
Dauphin as his father’s murderer, but he had little love for
his English allies. By marriage and skilful diplomacy he had
absorbed a great part of modern Holland into his already vast
inheritance and could assume the state and importance of an
independent sovereign. With England he felt that he could
treat as an equal, and now regarded with dismay the idea that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
she might permanently control both sides of the Channel. So
long as John, Duke of Bedford, brother of Henry V, acted
as regent for his young nephew with statesmanlike moderation,
an outward semblance of friendship was maintained; but Bedford
could with difficulty keep in order his quarrelsome, irresponsible
younger brother, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, who ruled in
England, and with still greater difficulty quell the sullen discontent
of the people of Paris who, suffering from starvation as the
result of a prolonged war, professed to regard a foreign king as
the source of all their troubles.</p>

<p>Only the prestige of English arms retained the loyalty
of northern France. ‘Two hundred English would drive five
hundred French before them,’ says a chronicler of the day; but
salvation was to come to France from an unexpected quarter,
and enable the same writer to add proudly, ‘Now two hundred
French would chase and beat four hundred English.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jeanne d’Arc</div>

<p>In the village of Domremy on the Upper Meuse there lived at
the beginning of the fifteenth century a peasant maid, Jeanne
d’Arc, who was, according to the description of a fellow villager,
‘modest, simple, devout, went gladly to Church and sacred
places, worked, sewed, hoed in the fields, and did what was
needful about the house.’ Up till the age of thirteen Jeanne had
been like other light-hearted girls, but it was then that a change
came into her life: voices seemed to draw her away from her companions
and to speak to her from behind a brilliant cloud, and
later she had visions of St. Catherine and of St. Michael, whose
painted effigies she knew in church.</p>

<p>‘I saw them with my bodily eyes as clearly as I see you,’ she
said when questioned as to these appearances, and admitted that
at first she was afraid but that afterwards they brought her
comfort. Always they came with the same message, in her own
words, ‘that she must change her course of life and do marvellous
deeds, for the King of Heaven had chosen her to aid the King
of France.’</p>

<p>Jeanne d’Arc was no hysterical visionary: she had always a
fund of common sense, and knew how ridiculous the idea that
she, an uneducated peasant girl, was called to save France would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
seem to the world. For some time she tried to forget the
message her Voices told her; but at last it was borne in upon
her that God had given her a mission, and from this time neither
her indignant father nor timid friends could turn her from her
purpose.</p>

<div id="ip_254" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_262.jpg" width="600" height="576" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FRANCE in 1429</div></div>

<p>Of all the difficulties and checks that she encountered before
at last, at the age of seventeen, she was allowed to have
audience with Charles VII, there is no space to tell here. News
of her persistence had spread abroad, and the torch-lit hall of the
castle into which Jeanne was shown was packed with gaily-clad
courtiers, and standing amongst them the King, in no way
distinguished from the others by his dress or any outward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
pomp. Every one believed that the peasant-maid would be
dazzled; but she, who had seen no portrait of the King and
lived all her life in the quiet little village of Domremy, showed
no confusion at the hundreds of eyes fixed on her. Recognizing
at once the man with whom her mission was concerned she went
straight to him and said, ‘My noble lord, I come from God
to help you and your realm.’</p>

<p>There must have been something arresting in Jeanne’s
simplicity and frankness contrasted with that corrupt atmosphere.
Even the feeble king was moved; and, when she had been
questioned and approved by his bishops, he allowed her to ride
forth, as she wished, with the armies of France to save for him the
important town of Orleans that was closely besieged by the
English. She went in armour with a sword in hand and a banner,
and those who rode with her felt her absolute belief in victory,
and into their hearts stole the magic influence of her own gay
courage and hope.</p>

<p>We have often spoken of ‘chivalry’, the ideal of good conduct
in the Middle Ages. The kings, princes, and knights, whose
prowess has made the chronicles of Froissart famous, were
to their journalist veritable heroes of chivalry, exponents of
courage, courtesy, and breeding. Yet to modern eyes these
qualities seem often tarnished, since the heroes who flaunted
them were in no way ashamed of vices like cruelty, selfishness,
or snobbery. A King John of France would die in a foreign
prison rather than break his parole, but he would disdainfully
ride down a ‘rabble’ of archers whom his negligence had left
too tired to fight his battles. The Black Prince would wait like
a servant on his royal prisoner, but accept as a brother-in-arms
to be succoured a human devil like Pedro the Cruel; or put
a town to the sword, as he did at Limoges, old men, women, and
children, because it had dared to set him at defiance.</p>

<p>There is nothing of this tarnish in the chivalry of the peasant-maid
who saved France. Pure gold were her knightly deeds,
yet achieved without a trace of the prig or the boaster. Jeanne
d’Arc was always human and therefore lovable, quick in her
anger at fraud, yet easily appeased; friendly to king and soldier<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
alike, yet never losing the simple dignity that was her safeguard
in court and camp. Of all mediaeval warriors of whom we
read she was the bravest; for she knew what fear was and would
often pray not to fall into the hands of her enemies alive, yet she
never shirked a battle or went into danger with a downcast
face. A slim figure, with her close-cropped dark hair and
shining eyes, she rode wherever the fight was thickest, always,
in the words of a modern biographer, ‘gay and gaily glad,’ quick
to see her opportunities and follow them up, joyful in victory,
generous to her foes, pitiful to the wounded and prisoners.</p>

<p>The sight of her awoke new courage in her countrymen,
dismay as at the supernatural in her enemies, who dubbed her a
witch and vowed to burn her.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Suddenly she turned at bay,’ says a contemporary account
of one of her battles, ‘and few as were the men with her
she faced the English and advanced on them swiftly with standard
displayed. Then fled the English shamefully and the
French came back and chased them into their works.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Orleans was relieved and entered, the reluctant, still half-doubting
Charles led to Reims, and there in the ancient capital
of France crowned, that all Frenchmen might know who was
their true king. ‘The Maid’ urged that the ceremony should
be followed by a rapid march on Paris; but favourites who
dreaded her influence whispered other counsels into the royal
ear, and Charles dallied and hesitated. When at last he
advanced it was to find that the bridges over the Seine had been
cut, not by the retreating English but by French treachery.</p>

<p>Paris was ripe for rebellion, and at the sight of ‘the Maid’
would have murdered her foreign garrison and opened her gates.
Bedford was in the north suppressing a revolt, yet Charles,
clutching at the excuse of the broken bridges, retreated southwards,
disbanding his army and leaving his defender to her fate.</p>

<p>Her Voices now warned Jeanne of impending capture and
death, but her mission was to save France, and hearing that the
Duke of Burgundy planned to take the important town of
Compiègne she rode to its defence with a small force. Under
the walls, in the course of a sortie, she was captured, refusing to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
surrender. ‘I have sworn and given my faith to another than you,
and I will keep my oath,’ she declared; and through the months that
followed, caged and fettered in a dark cell of the castle of Rouen,
exposed to the insults of the rough English archers, she maintained
her allegiance, saying to her foes of the prince who had failed
her so pitiably, ‘My King is the most noble of all Christians.’</p>

<p>Frenchmen (some of them bishops, canons, and lawyers of the
University of Paris), as well as Englishmen, were amongst those
who, after the mockery of a trial, sent Jeanne to be burned as a
heretic in the market-place of Rouen. Bravely as she had lived she
died, calling on her saints, begging the forgiveness of her enemies,
pardoning the evil they had done her. ‘That the world’, says
a modern writer, ‘might have no relic of her of whom the world
was not worthy, the English threw her ashes into the Seine.’</p>

<p>France, that had betrayed Jeanne d’Arc, needed no relic to
keep her memory alive. To-day men and women call her
Saint, and one miracle she certainly wrought, for she restored to
her country, that through years of anarchy had almost lost belief
in itself, the undying sense of its own nationality. ‘As to peace
with the English,’ she had said, ‘the only peace possible is for
them to return to their own land.’ Within little more than twenty
years from her death the mission on which she had ridden forth
from Domremy had been accomplished, and Calais, of all their
French possessions, alone remained to the enemies of France.</p>

<p>In summary of the Hundred Years’ War it may be said that
from the beginning the English fought in a lost cause. Fortune,
military genius, and dogged courage gave to their conquests a
fictitious endurance; but nationality is a foe invincible because
it has discovered the elixir of life; and when the tide of fortune
turned with the coming of ‘the Maid’ the ebb of English
discomfiture was very swift.</p>

<p>In 1435 died the Duke of Bedford, and in the same year
Charles VII, moved from his sluggishness, concluded at Arras a
treaty with Philip of Burgundy that secured his entry into Paris.
By good fortune his young rival in the ensuing campaigns, the
English King, Henry VI, had inherited, not the energy and valour
of his father, but an anaemic version of his French grandfather’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
insanity. Even before his first lapse into melancholia, he was the
weak puppet of first one set of influences, then another; and the
factions that strove to govern for their own interests in his name
lost him first Normandy and then Guienne. Finally they
carried their feuds back across the Channel to work out what
seemed an almost divine vengeance for the anarchy they
had caused in France, in the troubled ‘Wars of the Roses’.</p>

<p>Under Charles VII, well named <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">le bien servi</i>, France, as
she gradually freed herself from a foreign yoke, developed from
a mediaeval into the semblance of a modern state. Wise
ministers, whom in his later years the King had the sense to
substitute for his earlier workless favourites, built up the power
of the monarchy, restored its financial credit, and established
in the place of the disorderly ‘companies’ a standing army
recruited and controlled by the crown.</p>

<p>These things were not done without opposition, and the
rebellion of ‘the Praguerie’, in which were implicated nearly all
the leading nobles of France, including the King’s own son, the
Dauphin Louis, was a desperate attempt on the part of the
aristocracy to shake off the growing pressure of royal control. It
failed because the nation, as a whole, saw in submission to an absolute
monarch a means, imperfect perhaps but yet the only means
available at the moment, of securing the regeneration of France.</p>

<p>It is significant that when Louis XI succeeded to Charles VII
he inevitably followed in his father’s footsteps, forsaking the
interests of the class with which he had first allied himself,
in order to rule as an autocrat and fulfil the ideal of kingship in
his day.</p>

<span class="subhead">SPAIN IN THE MIDDLE AGES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Spain has been rightly described as ‘one of the most cut up
portions of the earth’s surface’. A glance at her map will show
the numerous mountain ranges that pierce into the heart of the
country, dividing her into districts utterly unlike both in climate
and soil. Even rivers that elsewhere in Europe, as in the case
of the Rhine and the Danube, act as roads of friendship and
commerce, are in Spain for the most part unnavigable, running
in wild torrents between precipitous banks so as to form an
additional hindrance to intercourse.</p>

<p>Geography thus came to play a very great part in the history
of mediaeval Spain, deciding that though overrun by Romans,
Vandals, Visigoths, and Saracens, no conquest should be ever
quite complete, since the invaded could always find inaccessible
refuges amongst the mountains. A spirit of provincial independence
was also fostered, as in Italy<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>&mdash;men learning to say first
not ‘I am a Spaniard,’ but ‘I am of Burgos,’ or ‘of Andalusia,’
or of ‘Barcelona,’ according to their neighbourhood.</p>

<p>When the Saracens defeated King Rodrigo and his Christian
army at the battle of Guadalete,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> we have seen that they found
the subjugation of southern and central Spain an easy matter.
Rich towns and districts passed into their hands almost without
a blow: the Gothic nobles and their families who should have
defended them, weakened by tribal dissensions, fled away northwards
to the mountains of Leon and Asturias, while the downtrodden
masses that they left behind soon welcomed their new
masters.</p>

<p>It was the policy of the Moors to grant a slave his freedom on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
his open acknowledgement of Allah as the one God and Mahomet
as his Prophet, while they allowed those Christians and Jews
who refused to surrender their faith to live in peace on the payment
of a poll-tax not required from Moslems.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>The SPANISH KINGDOMS<br />
  <span class="smaller">1263–1492</span></p></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">The Caliphate of Cordova</div>

<p>The capital of the Saracen kingdom, or ‘Caliphate’, that was
destined to survive practically unmolested for some three hundred
years, was the town of Cordova, whose capture the Moors believed
had been divinely inspired by Allah, since as their army under
cover of the darkness swept up to the walls, a terrific hail-storm
descended that deadened the clatter of approaching hoofs. From
a treacherous shepherd one of the captains learned of a part of
the fortifications easy to scale; and, climbing up undetected by
means of a fig-tree, he let down his long turban to assist his
fellows until a sufficient number had mounted to overpower the
guards and open the gates to the main army.</p>

<p>To the Spaniards, thus defeated almost in their sleep, Cordova
was a fallen city, disgraced by the presence of infidels; yet these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
same infidels were to make her luxury and brilliance rival the
almost fabulous glories of Bagdad and to win for her culture the
grudging admiration of Christian Europe. As we read of her
‘Palace of Pleasures’, ornamented with gold and precious stones,
of her woods of pomegranate and sweet almond, of her gardens and
perfumed fountains, of her luxurious rest-houses for travellers
without the walls, we are back in the atmosphere of some Eastern
fairy tale that clings also around the history of her Caliphs,
tinging with romance their loves, their hatreds, and their
rivalries.</p>

<p>There are other aspects of Moorish Spain hardly less wonderful
when contrasted with the haphazard national development
of the rest of Europe. Here were agriculture and industry
deliberately stimulated by a close and practical study of such
branches of knowledge as science and botany, algebra and
arithmetic. Arid soil, that under ordinary mediaeval neglect
would have been left a desert, became through canals and irrigation
a fertile plain, the garden of rice, sugar, cotton, or oranges.
Mathematics applied to everyday needs produced the mariner’s
compass; scientific brains and intelligent workmen the steel
blades of Toledo and Seville, the woven silk fabrics of Granada,
and the pottery and velvets of Valencia.</p>

<p>Yet, though knowledge was consciously applied for commercial
purposes, the Moors did not set up ‘Utility’ as an idol for their
scholars and tell them that only information that brought
material wealth in its train was worth having. Philosophy and
literature, as well as science, had their lecture-halls: Greece and
the East were searched by Caliphs’ orders for manuscripts to
fill their libraries; and so world-famous became Cordovan
professors that in the twelfth century Christian students hastened
to sit at their feet; and the translations of Aristotle by the Arabic
professor Averroës became one of the chief sources of authority
for the most orthodox ‘schoolmen’.</p>

<p>In their search after knowledge for its own sake, the Moors
accorded toleration to the best brains of all races. Elsewhere in
Europe the Jews were held accursed, protected by Christian
rulers so long as their money-bags could be squeezed like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
sponge, but exposed to insult, torture, and death whenever
popular fury, aroused by a crusade or an epidemic, demanded an
easy outlet for zeal in burning and pillaging houses.</p>

<p>Christian fanaticism had closed nearly every avenue of life
to the Jew save that of money-lender, in which he found few
competitors, since the law of the Church forbade usury. It then
proceeded to condemn him as a blood-sucker because of the high
rate of interest that his precarious position induced him to charge
for his loans. Thus, despised, hated, and feared, persecution
helped to breed in the average Jew the very vices for which he
was blamed, namely, the determination to sweat his Christian
neighbours, and an arrogant absorption in his own race to the
exclusion of all others.</p>

<p>In the cities of the Moors alone the Jew could rise to public
eminence, as in Cordova, where teachers of the race were
especially noted for their researches in medicine and surgery.
Many Spanish Israelites indeed became doctors, and proved
themselves so unmistakably superior in knowledge and skill to
the ordinary quacks that rulers of Christian states were thankful
to employ them when their health was in danger.</p>

<p>It would seem at first sight as if this happy kingdom of the
Moors, where culture, comfort, and toleration reigned, must in
time succeed in spreading its civilizing influence over Europe;
but there was another and darker side to Moslem Spain. The
Caliphate of Cordova, like other Moslem states, was the victim
of a form of government whose sole bond was the religion of
Islam. Its ruler was a tyrant independent of any popular
control, and could send even his Grand Vizier, or chief minister,
to death by a word. Such an exalted position had its penalties,
and the Caliph must keep continual watch lest he should find
enemies ready to slay him, not merely amongst his servants, but
even more amongst his sons or brothers. Since polygamy
prevailed, in nearly every family there were children of rival
mothers, who learned from their cradles to hate and fear each
other. It depended only, as it seemed, on a little luck or cunning
who would succeed to the royal title, and few scrupled to use
dagger or poison to ensure themselves the coveted honour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Out of the feuds and plots of the Moorish court and the rise
and fall of Emirs and Sultans in the provinces, Moorish Spain
prepared its own downfall during the three centuries that it
dominated southern and central Spain.</p>

<p>Away in the north, in Asturias, the ‘cradle of the Spanish
race’, where every peasant considers himself an ‘hidalgo’ or
noble, in the kingdoms of Leon and Navarre, in the counties of
Castile and Barcelona, the descendants of the once enfeebled
Goths were meanwhile developing into a race of warriors.</p>

<p>Though ardent in his devotion to Christianity, weaving supernatural
aid around every victory, the Spaniard did not, in what
might be called the first period of ‘the Reconquest’, show any
acute dislike of the Moor. His early struggles were not for
religion but for independence, and often a Prince or Count would
join with some friendly Emir to overthrow a Christian rival.
‘All Kings are alike to me so long as they pay my price!’ These
words of Rodrigo (Ruy) Diaz, the greatest of Spanish heroes,
were typical of his race in the age in which he lived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Cid</div>

<p>This Ruy Diaz, ‘El Campeador’, or ‘the Challenger’, as the
Christians named him, but more popularly called by his Arabic
title ‘Al Said’ or ‘the Cid’, meaning ‘the Chief’, was brave,
generous, boastful, and treacherous. A Castilian by race, he
held his allegiance to the King of Leon, whose wars he sometimes
condescended to wage, as in no way sacred; but when
banished by that monarch, who had well-founded suspicions of
his loyalty, proceeded unabashed to fight on behalf of his late
master’s enemy, the Moorish Sultan of Saragossa.</p>

<p>It is evident from the old chronicles and ballads that the Cid
himself could rouse and keep the affection of those who served
him. When he sent for his relations and friends to tell them
that he had been banished by the King of Leon and to ask who
would go with him into exile, we are told that ‘Alvar Fañez, who
was his cousin, answered, “Cid, we will all go with you through
desert and through peopled country, and never fail you. In
your service will we spend our mules and horses, our wealth and
our garments, and ever while we live be unto you loyal friends
and vassals”: and they all confirmed what Alvar Fañez had said.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
Mediaeval Spain was always ready to admire a warrior; and
a great part of the Cid’s charm lay, no doubt, in his prowess on
the battle-field, when, charging with his good sword ‘Tizona’ in
hand, none could withstand the onslaught. To this admiration
was added the deeper feeling of fellowship. Their hero might
spill the blood of hundreds to attain his ambitions, but he was
yet no noble after the mediaeval French type, despising those of
inferior rank; rather a full-blooded Spaniard, keen in his sympathy
with all other Spaniards.</p>

<p>As he rode from the town of Burgos on his way to exile the
Cid called Alvar Fañez to his side and said, ‘Cousin, the poor
have no part in the wrong which the King hath done us.... See
now that no wrong be done unto them along our road.’ ‘And an
old woman who was standing at her door said, “Go in a lucky
minute and make spoil of whatever you wish.”’</p>

<p>The Cid’s ‘luck’, or perhaps it would be truer to say his
admirable discretion, carried him triumphantly through many
campaigns&mdash;at times reconciled with the Christian king and fighting
under his banner, at others laying waste his lands as
a Moorish ally. At length he reached the summit of his fortunes
and carved himself a principality out of the Moorish province of
Valencia; and as ruler of this state made little pretence of being
any one’s vassal, but boasted that he, a Rodrigo, would free
Andalusia as another Rodrigo had let her fall into bondage.</p>

<p>This kingly achievement was denied him, for even heroes
fail; so that a time came when he fell ill, and the Moors invaded
his land, and because he could no longer fight against them he
turned his face to the wall and died. Yet his last victory was
still to come; for his followers, who had served him so faithfully,
embalmed his body, and they set him on his war-horse and
bound ‘Tizona’ in his hand, and so they led him out of the city
against his foes. Instead of weeping and lamentations the Cid’s
widow had ordered the church bells to be rung and war trumpets
to be blown so that the Moors did not know their great enemy
was dead; but imagining that he charged amongst them, terrible
in his wrath as of old, they broke and fled.</p>

<p>In spite of this victory Valencia fell back under the rule of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
Moors, but she never forgot ‘Ruy Diaz’, and is proud to this
day to be called ‘Valencia of the Cid’.</p>

<p>The second period of the reconquest of Spain by the
Christians may be called the crusading period, and continued
until the fall of Granada in 1492. It began not at any fixed
date, but in the gradual realization by the Christian states during
the twelfth century that their war with the Moors was something
quite distinct and ever so much more important than their
almost fraternal feuds with one another. This dawning conviction
was intensified into a faith, when the Moorish kingdom,
that, owing to the feebleness and corruption of its government,
had almost ceased to be a kingdom and split up into a number
of warring states, was towards the end of the twelfth century
overrun and temporarily welded together by a fierce Berber
tribe from North Africa, the Almohades.</p>

<p>The Almohades, like earlier followers of Mahomet, were
definitely hostile to both Christians and Jews, and so the feeling
of religious bitterness grew; and the war that at first was
a series of victories for the infidel developed its character of
a crusade.</p>

<p>Other crusades, we have seen, gained public support; and at
the beginning of the thirteenth century Pope Innocent III, no
less alive to his responsibility towards Spain than towards
the Holy Land, sent a recruiting appeal to all the countries
of Europe. This was answered by the arrival of bands of
Templars, Hospitallers, and other young warriors anxious to
win their spurs against the heathen. Spain herself founded
several Military Orders, of which the most famous was the
Order of Santiago, that is, of St. James, called after the national
saint, whose tomb at Compostella in the north was one of the
favourite shrines visited by pilgrims.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Las Navas de Tolosa</div>

<p>At the head of the Christian host, when it rode across the
mountains to the plain of Las Navas de Tolosa, where it was
destined to fight one of the most decisive of Spanish battles, was
Alfonso VIII, ‘the Good’, of Castile, who had warred against
the Moors ever since his coronation as a lad of fifteen. With
him went his allies, the King of Navarre, commanding the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
right wing, and Pedro II, King of Aragon, commanding the
left.</p>

<p>All day long the battle raged; and the Christian kings and
their knights fought like heroes; but in spite of their efforts they
were pressed back and defeat seemed almost certain. ‘Here
must we die,’ exclaimed Alfonso bitterly, determined to sell his
life at a high price; but Rodrigo Ximenez, the fiery Archbishop
of Toledo, replied, ‘Not so, Señor, here shall we conquer!’ and
with his cross-bearer he charged so resolutely against the foe
that the Christians, rallying to save their sacred standard, drove
the Moors headlong from the field. So overwhelming was the
victory that the advance of the Almohades was completely
checked, and the Christian states became the dominating power
in the peninsula.</p>

<p>At first in their battles amongst themselves it had been
Navarre that took the lead amongst the Christian states; but
later this little mountain kingdom, that lay across the Pyrenees
like a saddle and was half French in her sympathies and outlook,
lost her supremacy. Spanish interest ceased to be centred
in France, and focused itself instead in the lands that were
slowly being recovered from the Moors. Portugal declared
itself an independent kingdom, Castile broke off the yoke of
Navarre and united with Leon, Aragon absorbed the important
province of Catalonia, with its thriving seaport Barcelona.</p>

<div class="sidenote">James ‘the Conqueror’</div>

<p>One of the most famous of Aragonese heroes in the thirteenth
century was James ‘the Conqueror’, son of Pedro II of Aragon,
who during the Albigensian Crusade had died fighting on behalf
of his brother and vassal, the Count of Provence, against
Simon de Montfort.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> James, who was only six at the time, was
taken prisoner by the cruel Count, but Innocent III insisted
that he should be handed back to his own people, and these
gave him to the Templars to educate. It was natural that in
such a military environment the boy should grow up a soldier;
but he was to prove himself a statesman as well, and a lover of
literature, writing in the Catalan dialect a straightforward, manly
chronicle of his reign, and encouraging his Catalan subjects in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
the devotion to poetry they had shared from early days with
their Provençal neighbours.</p>

<p>According to contemporary accounts the young king was
handsome beyond all ordinary standards, nearly seven feet
tall, and well built in proportion. Unfortunately he was so
attractive that he became thoroughly spoilt, and was dissolute in
his way of life and uncontrolled in his temper. When in one
of his rages he was capable of any crime, though ordinarily so
generous and tender-hearted that he hated to sign a death-warrant.
In his chronicle he tells us how on one of his
campaigns he found a swallow had built her nest by the roundel
of his tent: ‘So I ordered the men not to take it down,’ he
says, ‘until the swallow had flown away with her young, since
she had come trusting to my protection.’</p>

<p>The combination of good looks, brains, and chivalry found in
James I appealed to the imagination of the Aragonese, but still
more did his fighting qualities that were typically Spanish. ‘It
has ever been the fate of my race’, he wrote, ‘to conquer or die
in battle’; and when quite a small boy he made up his mind
that he would become a crusader.</p>

<p>For many years after he was declared old enough to reign for
himself King James was forced to spend his time and energy in
subduing the nobles who during his long minority had been
allowed to become a law unto themselves. This vindication of
his authority accomplished, he led his armies against the Moors,
and under his conquering banner ‘Valencia of the Cid’ passed
finally into Christian hands.</p>

<p>The Moorish kingdom was now reduced to Granada in the
south and the dependent province of Murcia to the north-east
that was claimed by the Castilians, though Alfonso ‘the Learned’
of Castile was quite unable to make himself master of it.</p>

<p>Hearing of the Aragonese victories in Valencia, Alfonso, who
was ‘the Conqueror’s’ son-in-law, asked King James if he
would help him by invading Murcia, a project that first aroused
the anger of the Aragonese because it seemed to them that they
were expected to do the hard work in order that some one else
might reap the spoils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
King James was more far-seeing than his subjects and held
a different view. The Moors were weak at the moment; but,
owing to the influx of fresh warriors from North Africa, they
had always been able to rally their power in the past and might
do so again. ‘If the King of Castile happen to lose his land I
shall hardly be safe in mine,’ was his shrewd summary of the
case; and with this he invaded and overran Murcia, which he
gave to his son-in-law in 1262.</p>

<p>This date, 1262, though it marked no fresh acquisition of
territory for Aragon, was nevertheless an epoch in her history.
Hitherto her main interest had been identical with Castile’s&mdash;namely,
the freedom of Spain from the infidel&mdash;but now, owing
to the conquest of Murcia, she was surrounded by Christian
neighbours, and what remained of the crusade had become the
business of Castile alone. Early in his reign also, King James had
closed another chapter in Aragonese history, when, as a result
of his father’s defeat and death, he had been forced to cede all
Catalonian claims to Provence, and thus to put away for ever
the prospect of absorbing France that had dazzled his ancestors.</p>

<p>Where, then, should Aragon turn her victorious arms? King
James, a true Aragonese, had already answered this question,
when in 1229 he began the conquest of the Balearic Islands,
thus clearly recognizing that his country’s natural outlook for
expansion was neither north nor south, but eastwards. Already
Catalan fishermen and the merchants of Barcelona were disputing
the commercial overlordship of the Mediterranean with their
fellows of Marseilles and the Italian Republics, and thenceforward
Aragonese kings were to take a hand in the game,
supporting commerce with diplomacy and the sword.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peter III of Aragon</div>

<p>James ‘the Conqueror’ did not die in battle-harness, as he
had predicted, but in the robe of a Cistercian monk, expiating
in the seclusion of a monastery the sins of his tempestuous,
pleasure-loving youth. His tradition as a warrior descended to
his son Pedro III, under whose rule Aragon entered on her
campaign of Italian conquests.</p>

<p>Both the excuse for this undertaking and the occasion have
been noticed elsewhere in another connexion. The excuse was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
the execution of Conradin,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> last legitimate descendant of the
Neapolitan Hohenstaufen. As he stood on the scaffold calmly
awaiting his death, the boy, for he was little more, had flung
his gauntlet amongst the crowd. The action spoke for
itself, the one bitter word ‘revenge’; and a partisan who
witnessed it, kneeling swiftly, picked up the glove and bore it
away to Spain. Here he presented it to Pedro III, to whose
wife Constance, the daughter of an illegitimate son of Frederick II,
the claims of the Italian Hohenstaufen had descended.</p>

<p>Pedro did not forget the glove or its message; and when the
Sicilians, rising in wrath at the Easter Vespers,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> massacred
their Angevin tyrants, it was Aragonese ships that brought them
succour, and Pedro who defied the anathemas of the Pope and
the power of France to drive him from his new throne.</p>

<p>All the failures and victories of the years that followed, when
Aragonese and Angevin claimants deluged ‘the Kingdom’ and
adjoining island with blood, are more a matter of Italian than
Spanish history, and it is with Castile that the interests of the
peninsula become mainly concerned.</p>

<p>Castile in later mediaeval times consisted of some two-thirds
of the whole area of Spain, stretching from the Bay of Biscay in
the north to the confines of the Moorish kingdom of Granada in
the south. As her name suggests, she was a land of castles,
built originally, not like the strongholds of Stephen’s lawless
barons in England&mdash;to maintain a tyranny over the countryside&mdash;but
as military outposts in each fresh stage of the reconquest
from Islam. Naturally those who lived in such outposts, and
might be wakened any night to take part in a border foray or to
withstand a surprise attack, expected to receive special privileges
in compensation. This was as it should be, and grateful Kings
of Castile, in order to encourage traders as well as knights and
princes to settle on their dangerous southern border, offered
concessions in the form of charters and revenues with a reckless
prodigality at which other European monarchs would have
shuddered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
Trouble began when, with the steady advance of the crusading
armies, outposts ceased to be outposts; and yet their inhabitants,
naturally enough again, saw no reason why they should be
deprived of the privileges and riches that they had won in the
past. Had they known how to use their independence, when
danger from the Moors diminished, in securing a government
conscious of national needs and aspirations, Spain might have
become the political leader of Europe. Unfortunately the average
Castilian felt only a selfish sense of the advantages that liberty
might afford, without realizing in the least that their possession
entailed heavy responsibilities. Thus he allowed his country
to degenerate into anarchy.</p>

<p>War seemed the natural atmosphere of life to the Castilian
of pure blood, whose ancestors had all been crusaders. Unable
to compete in agriculture or industry with the thrifty Moslems
or Jews who remained behind on the lands that he reconquered,
he decided that labour, except with the sword, was the hall-mark
of slaves; and this unfortunate fallacy, widely adopted, became
the ultimate ruin of Spain. It turned her from the true road of
national prosperity, which can be gained only by solid work,
while it prevented nobles and town representatives from understanding
one another, and so rendered them incapable of common
action in the ‘Cortes’, or national parliament. The fallacy went
farther, for it made war between noble and noble seem a natural
outlet for martial zeal when no Moslem force was handy on
which to whet Christian swords.</p>

<p>The part played by the King in this land of independent
crusaders and aristocratic cut-throats was difficult and precarious.
Though not so legally bound by the concessions he had been
forced to make as in Aragon&mdash;where no king might pass a law
without the consent of his Cortes and where the ‘Justiciar’,
a popular minister, disputed his supreme right of justice&mdash;mediaeval
Castilian monarchs were in practice very much at the mercy
of their subjects.</p>

<p>Henry II of England had been able to burn down his barons’
castles and hang some of their owners, thus paving the way
of royal supremacy; but kings of Castile could scarcely adopt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
such drastic measures against subjects usually more wealthy than
themselves, whose castles were required as national fortresses,
and whose retainers formed the main part of Christian armies
against the Moors. Instead, custom and circumstances seemed
ever forcing the rulers of Castile to grant new liberties, and to
alienate their lands and revenues in constant rewards and bribes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ‘Siete Partidas’</div>

<p>This was one of the failings of Alfonso ‘the Learned’, who
in spite of his boast, ‘Had I been present at the Creation I would
have arranged the world better,’ was certainly not ‘the Wise’,
as he is sometimes called. Alfonso was a great reader and
a scientist in advance of his day; but the best work that he ever
did for his kingdom was the publication of the <cite>Siete Partidas</cite>
(Seven Divisions), a compilation of all the previous laws of Spain,
both Roman and Gothic, drawn up and arranged in a single
code. For the rest, apart from his somewhat academic cleverness,
he was vain, irresolute, and superficial. On one occasion he
divorced his wife; and then, when the new wife he had chosen,
a Norwegian princess, had already arrived at a Spanish port,
he decided to send her away and retain the old. This capriciousness
was of a piece with the rest of his actions.</p>

<p>During the ‘Great Interregnum’<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> Alfonso was one of the
claimants for the imperial crown, but had neither money nor
sufficient popularity to carry through this foolish project, for
which he heavily overtaxed his people. He also planned an
invasion of Africa in grand crusading style, but had to turn his
attention instead to struggling against unruly sons. He died
with little accomplished save his reputation for wisdom.</p>

<p>The reign of Alfonso X was a prelude to a century and a half
of anarchy in Castile, a period when few of her kings could
claim to be either ‘wise’ or ‘learned’, and when four of them by
ill fortune ascended the throne in childhood, and so presented
their nobles with extra opportunities for seeking their own
ambitions at the royal expense.</p>

<p>On one struggle during this century and a half we have already
touched&mdash;the bitter feud between Pedro ‘the Cruel’, the Nero
of Spain, and his half-brother, Henry of Trastamara.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> There is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
no end to the list of crimes of which this monster has been
accused, from strangling his rival’s mother, and calmly watching
while his half-brother, a twin of Henry of Trastamara, was
pursued and cut down unarmed by the royal guard, to ordering
that the young bride with whom he had refused to live should
be given poisonous herbs that she might die.</p>

<p>Stained, indeed, must the Black Prince have felt his honour
when he discovered what a brother-in-arms he had crossed the
Pyrenees to aid&mdash;one who would massacre prisoners for sheer
love of butchery, burn a priest for prophesying his death, and
murder an archbishop in a fit of savagery. It is probably true
to describe this worst of the Spanish kings as mad: many of
his atrocities were so meaningless, such obvious steps to his own
downfall, because they alienated those who tried to remain loyal
to his cause. His end, when it came, rejoiced the popular heart
and imagination, for Pedro, according to tradition, was at last
entrapped by the crafty Du Guesclin, lately released from
imprisonment by the Black Prince, and once more in the service
of Henry of Trastamara.</p>

<p>King Pedro believed that every man had a price, and, on
Du Guesclin’s pretence that he might be bought over, stole
secretly one night to the Frenchman’s tent. Here he found his
hated brother with some of his courtiers who cried aloud ‘Look,
Señor, it is your enemy.’ ‘I am! I am!’ screamed Pedro
furiously, seeing he was betrayed, and flung himself on his
brother, while the latter struck at him with his dagger. Over
and over they rolled in the half-light of a tallow candle, until
Pedro, who had gained the upper hand, fumbled for his poignard
with which to strike a fatal blow. Then, according to the old
ballad, Du Guesclin interfered. ‘I neither make king nor mar
king, but I serve my master,’ he said, and turned Pedro over
on his back, enabling those who were standing by to dispatch him
with their knives. The tale, if creditable to Du Guesclin’s loyalty,
is hardly so to his love of fair play, but the murdered king had
lived like a wild animal, and it is difficult to feel any regret
that he died like one instead of in battle as a knight.</p>

<p>The House of Trastamara was now established on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
Castilian throne by the triumphant Henry II. Some years
later it gave also a king to its eastern neighbour, when the royal
House of Aragon had become extinct in the male line. This
was the Infante Ferdinand, a man of mature judgement, who
had already won golden opinions for his honesty and statesmanship
when acting as guardian for his young nephew, John II
of Castile.</p>

<p>Both kingdoms, but more especially Castile, were to remain
victims of civil wars and of frequent periods of anarchy for
another half-century. John II, deprived of his uncle’s wise
guidance, devoted his time to composing love-songs and surrendered
his weak will to a royal favourite, Alvaro de Luna,
without whose consent, tradition says, he dared not even go to
bed. The result was incessant turbulence, for the nobles hated
the arrogant and all-powerful upstart, who managed the court
as he pleased, and steadily added to his own estates and
revenues. Yet, having brought about his downfall and death,
they had no better government with which to replace his
tyranny.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry IV of Castile</div>

<p>Under John’s son and successor Castile fared even worse;
for Henry IV was not merely weak but vicious, so that he rolled
the crown in the mire of scandal and degradation. Government
of any sort was now at an end. ‘Our swords’, wrote a contemporary
Castilian, recalling this time of nightmare, ‘were employed,
not to defend the boundaries of Christendom, but to rip up the
entrails of our country.... He was most esteemed among us
who was strongest in violence: justice and peace were far
removed.’</p>

<p>In their efforts to save something of their lives and fortunes
from this wreck, towns and villages formed <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Hermandades</i> or
‘brotherhoods’&mdash;that is, troops of armed men who pursued and
punished criminals; but these leagues without support from the
crown were not strong enough to deal with the worst offenders,
the wealthy nobles, who could cover their misdeeds with lavish
bribery or threats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ferdinand and Isabel</div>

<p>At this moment in Castile’s history, when she had sunk to a
depth from which she could not save herself, Henry IV died,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
and was succeeded on the throne by his sister, Isabel, a girl in
years but already a statesman in outlook and discretion.
Henry IV had attempted to secure personal advantages in his
lifetime by arranging various marriages for Isabel, first with a
French prince, then with the King of Portugal, and finally with
one of his own worthless favourites, and his sister had won his
dislike by her steady refusal to agree to any of these alliances.
Secretly, indeed, she had married her cousin Ferdinand, heir to
the throne of Aragon, a youth already distinguished for his
military abilities and shrewd common sense.</p>

<p>As joint rulers of Castile and Aragon Isabel and Ferdinand
dominated Spain, and were able to impose their will even on
the most powerful of their rebellious subjects, taking back the
crown lands that had been recklessly given away, organizing a
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Santa Hermandad</i>, or ‘Holy Brotherhood’, on the model of
previous local efforts to ensure order, and themselves holding
supreme tribunals to judge important cases of robbery and
murder. In this display of authority the land not merely
acquiesced but rejoiced, utterly weary of an independence the
misuse of which had produced licence instead of freedom.</p>

<p>Thus it was that a strong monarchy, such as Louis XI was
able to establish in France at the end of the Hundred Years’
War, and the Tudors in England after the Wars of the Roses,
was also organized and maintained in Spain. Under its despotic
sway many popular liberties were lost, but peace was gained at
home, and glory and honour abroad above all expectations.
The perpetual crusade against the Moors had always touched
the imagination of Europe&mdash;now its crowning achievement, the
Conquest of Granada, dazzled their eyes with all the pageantry
and pomp of victory so dear to mediaeval minds.</p>

<p>Hardly was this wonder told when news came that a Genoese
adventurer had discovered, in the name of Isabel and Ferdinand,
a Spanish empire of almost fabulous wealth beyond the Atlantic.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>
To these triumphs were added conquests in Italy, fruits of
Ferdinand’s Aragonese ambitions.</p>

<p>The glory of Spain belongs to modern not to mediaeval<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
history; but just as a man or woman is a development of the
child, so this, the first nation in Europe as she became in the
sixteenth century, proved the outcome of the qualities and vices
of an earlier age. Above all things she became, as we should
expect, a nation of warriors, inspired with ardour for the
Catholic Faith, arrogant and ambitious. To her strength was
added a fatal weakness bred of conceit and a narrow outlook,
that is the intolerance that admired Ferdinand and Isabel’s
ruthless Inquisition and rejoiced in the expulsion of thousands
of thrifty Jews and Moors.</p>

<p>Spain was a born conqueror among nations, but what she
conquered she had learned neither the sympathy nor adaptability
to govern. Thus the empire won by her courage and
endurance was destined to slip from her grasp.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Rudolf I</div>

<p>The accession of Rudolf of Habsburg<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> as King of the Romans
in 1273 is a turning-point in the history of mediaeval Germany.
Hitherto private or imperial ambitions had prevented even well-intentioned
emperors from exerting their full strength against
anarchy at home; while a few like Frederick II had deliberately
ignored German interests. The result had been a steady process
of disintegration, perpetuating racial and class feuds; but now
at last the tradition was broken and an Emperor chosen who was
willing to forgo the glory of dominating Rome and Lombardy in
order to build up a nation north of the Alps.</p>

<p>The election itself was somewhat of a surprise; for Rudolf
belonged to an obscure and far from wealthy family, owning
territory in Alsace and amongst the Swiss mountains. What is
interesting to the modern world is that the man who did most to
influence the Electors in their choice, and thus helped to plant a
Habsburg with his feet on the ladder of greatness, was a
Hohenzollern.</p>

<p>Count Rudolf at the time of his election was a middle-aged
man of considerable military experience, kindly, simple, and
resolute. He had won the affection of his own vassals by helping
them in their struggles against the unjust demands of local tyrants,
such as feudal bishops or the barons who built castles amongst
the crags and sent out armed retainers to waylay merchants and
travellers. One tale records how, with an apparently small force,
he advanced boldly against a robber fastness, thus encouraging
the garrison to issue out and attack him. When the robbers
approached, however, they found to their horror that each of
their mounted opponents had another armed man seated behind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
him, and so, hopelessly outnumbered as well as outwitted, they
were forced to surrender or fly.</p>

<p>Rudolf needed all his military ability when he was chosen
Emperor; for the most powerful ruler in central Europe at that
time, King Ottocar of Bohemia, refused to recognize him, being
furious that he himself had not received a single vote, while an
obscure count from the Swiss mountains had been elected his
master. The truth was that Ottocar was well known to be
arrogant and bad-tempered, so that all the Electors were afraid
of him; and there was general rejoicing when, in a battle against
King Rudolf near Vienna, he was killed and the throne of
Bohemia passed to his son, a boy of twelve.</p>

<p>This victory was the real beginning of the Habsburg fortunes;
for Rudolf by the confiscation of the Austrian provinces of
Carinthia, Styria, and Carniola, that had belonged to his rival,
established his family as one of the great territorial powers of
the Empire. Unfortunately his character seemed to deteriorate
with success, and his greed for lands and power to increase with
acquisition.</p>

<p>Instead of finding Rudolf the protector of their liberties, his
sturdy Swiss vassals now had to defend themselves against his
encroachments; and in the year 1291 some of them in self-defence
formed what they called a ‘Perpetual League’, whose covenant,
drawn up a few years later in a simplified form, is just as sacred
a charter of liberty to the Swiss as Magna Charta to the English.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Know, all men,’ it began, ‘that we, the people of the Valley
of Uri, the Community of the Valley of Schwyz, and the
mountaineers of the Lower Valley, seeing the malice of the times,
have solemnly agreed and bound ourselves by oath to aid and
defend each other with all our might and main, with our lives
and property, both within and without our boundaries, each at
his own expense, against every enemy whatever who shall
attempt to molest us, whether singly or collectively.’</p></blockquote>

<p>This was the first ‘Confederation of the Swiss’, the union of
the three provinces of Uri, Schwyz, and the ‘Lower Valley’, or
‘Unterwalden’; but Rudolf died in the same year 1291, so that
the Swiss struggle for liberty really began against his son, Albert
of Austria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
Rudolf, in spite of the Concordat he had made with the Pope
renouncing his claims over papal territory, had never been to
Italy to be crowned Emperor, so that he died merely ‘King of
the Romans’; and the Electors of Germany made this one of
their excuses for not immediately choosing his son to succeed him.</p>

<p>Like Ottocar, Albert was overbearing and ambitious; and had
at once on his father’s death obtained possession of the entire
family estates, without allowing any of them to pass to Count
John of Habsburg, a son of his elder brother who had died some
years before. Albert was a persistent man when he wished for
anything very ardently, and, having failed to be elected Emperor
a first time, he set himself to win friends and allies amongst the
powerful families all over Germany. So successful was he that
when a fresh imperial vacancy occurred in 1298 the choice of the
Electors fell on him.</p>

<p>This realization of his ambitions spurred Albert’s energies to
fresh efforts. He was now overlord of the Empire, but on his
own estates amongst the Swiss mountains his will was often
disputed by citizens and peasants, who claimed to have imperial
permission for their independence. As Emperor, Rudolf could
withdraw privileges light-heartedly granted by predecessors who
were not Habsburgs; and with this in view he sent bailiffs and
stewards to govern in his name, with orders to enforce complete
submission to his demands.</p>

<p>Concerning the events that followed, fiction has built round
fact a wonderful tale, that, whether true or false in its main
incidents, is characteristic of mediaeval Swiss daring, and a fit
introduction to a great national struggle for liberty.</p>

<p>Gessler, legend tells us, was the most hated of all Albert’s
Austrian governors. So narrow-minded was he that he hated to
see the peasants building themselves stone houses instead of
living in mud hovels, and would take every opportunity of
humbling and oppressing them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Story of William Tell</div>

<p>Once he set up a hat on a pole in the market-place of one of
the principal towns, and ordered every one who passed to salute
it. A certain William Tell, either through obstinacy or carelessness,
failed to do so, on which Gessler, who had found out that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
he was an archer, ordered him as a punishment to shoot at long
range an apple placed on his son’s head. In vain the father
begged for any other sentence: Gessler only laughed. Seeing
that entreaty was useless, Tell took two shafts, and with one he
pierced straight through the apple. Gessler was annoyed at his
success and, looking at him suspiciously, asked, ‘What, then, is
the meaning of thy second arrow?’ The archer hesitated; and
not until he had been promised his life if he would answer the
truth would he speak. Then he said bluntly, ‘Had I injured my
child my second shaft should not have missed thy heart.’
There was a murmur of applause from the townsmen, but the
governor was enraged at such a bold answer. ‘Truly,’ he
shouted, ‘I have promised thee life; but I will throw thee into a
dungeon, where never more shall sun nor moon let fall their rays
on thee.’ The legend goes on to relate how, though bound and
closely guarded, the gallant archer made his escape, and hiding
in the bushes not far from the road where Gessler must pass to
his castle, he shot him and fled. ‘It is Tell’s shaft,’ said the
dying man, as he fell from his horse. By his daring struggle
against the tyrant William Tell became one of Switzerland’s
national heroes.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the Swiss, Albert was so busy as ruler of all
Germany that he could not give the full attention to subduing his
rebellious vassals that he would have liked; and when at last he
found time to visit his own estates, just as he was almost within
sight of the family castle of the Habsburgs, he was murdered,
not by a peasant, but by his nephew Count John, who considered
that he had been unjustly robbed of his inheritance.</p>

<p>The task of attempting to reduce the Swiss to submission fell
on a younger son of King Albert, Duke Leopold, a youth who
despised the peasants of his native valleys quite as heartily
as the French their ‘Jacques Bonhomme’. His army, as it
wandered carelessly up the Swiss mountains, without order or
pickets, resembled a hunting-party seeking a day’s amusement;
and on their saddles his horsemen carried bundles of rope
to hang the rebels and bind together the cattle they expected to
capture as spoils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
Meeting with no opposition, Duke Leopold began to ascend
the frozen side of the Morgarten; and here, as he advanced
between high ridges, discovered himself in a death-trap. From
the heights above, the Swiss of the Forest Cantons rained
a deadly fire of stones and missiles that threw the horses below
into confusion, slipping and falling on the smooth surface of
the track. Then there descended from all sides small bodies
of peasants armed with halberds, so sure-footed amid the snow
and ice that they cut down the greater part of the Duke’s forces
before they could extricate themselves and find safe ground.</p>

<p>Leopold escaped, but he rode from the carnage, according to
his chronicler, ‘distracted and with a face like death’. Swiss
independence had been vindicated by his defeat; and round the
nucleus of the forest republics there soon gathered others,
bound together in a federal union that, while securing the safety
of all, guaranteed to each their liberties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles ‘the Bold’</div>

<p>Other campaigns still remained to be fought on behalf of complete
Swiss independence; and one of the most important
of these occurred towards the end of the fifteenth century, and
was waged against a military leader of Europe, Charles, Duke of
Burgundy, son and successor of that Philip ‘the Good’ who had
played so great a part in the latter half of the Hundred Years’
War.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>This Charles ‘the Bold’, sometimes called also ‘the Rash’ or
‘the Terrible’, was in many ways a typical mediaeval soldier.
From his boyhood he had loved jousting&mdash;not the magnificent
tourneys, in which as heir to the dukedom he could count
on making a safe as well as a spectacular display of knightly
courage, but real contests in which, disguised in plain armour,
his strength and skill could alone win him laurels and avoid
death. Strong and healthy, brave and impetuous, he loved the
atmosphere of war with all its hazards and hardships. ‘I never
heard him complain of weariness,’ wrote Philip de Commines, a
French historian who was at one time in his service, ‘and
I never saw in him a sign of fear.’</p>

<p>To qualities like courage and endurance Charles added failings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
that were often his undoing&mdash;a hot temper, impatience, and
a tendency to under-estimate the wits of his opponents. His
clever, ambitious brain was always weaving plans, but he did not
realize that he had neither the skill nor the political vision
to keep many irons in the fire without letting one get too hot
or another over-cold.</p>

<p>Like all mediaeval rulers of Burgundy, he was faced by the
problem of his middle kingdom, with its large commercial
population, whose trade interests must be considered alongside
his own territorial ambitions. To the rulers of both France and
the Empire he was tenant-in-chief for different provinces, and
either of these potentates could cause him discomfort by stirring
up trouble amongst his subjects, or else unite with him to
his great advantage in order to defy the authority of the other.</p>

<p>At first Charles tried to increase his territory in the west
at the expense of Louis XI of France, and even gained some
showy triumphs, but gradually he found that he was no match in
diplomacy for that astute king, ‘the universal spider’, as a
contemporary christened him; and so he turned his attention to
his eastern border.</p>

<p>Here he discovered that a Habsburg, Sigismund of the Tyrol,
had become involved in a quarrel with the Swiss Cantons, and
had been forced to promise them a large sum of money that he
was quite unable to pay. When Charles offered to lend him the
sum required if he would hand over as security his provinces of
Alsace and Breisgau, Sigismund, seeing no other alternative,
reluctantly agreed. So remote was the prospect of repayment
that the Duke of Burgundy at once began to rule the territories
that he held in pawn as though they were his own, and might
indeed have absorbed them quietly amongst his possessions had
not the French ‘Spider’ chosen to take a hand in the game.
Louis XI had never forgiven Charles for his clumsy attempts to
rob him of French territory, and now, weaving a web that was
to entangle the Burgundian to his ultimate ruin, he secretly
pointed out to the Swiss how much more dangerous a neighbour
was Charles ‘the Bold’ than Sigismund ‘the Penniless’. Let
Sigismund, he suggested, agree to withdraw all Habsburg claims<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
to towns and lands belonging to the Cantons, and let the Cantons
in return pledge themselves to pay for the restoration of the lost
provinces.</p>

<p>This compromise was finally arranged, and the exasperated
Charles called upon to hand back the lands he already considered
his own. Instead of complying he made overtures to both Louis
and the Emperor, with such success that when the Swiss troops
invaded Alsace in order to gain possession of that province for
Sigismund, they found themselves without the powerful allies on
whose support they had counted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battles of Granson and Morat</div>

<p>Charles, ever too prone to over-estimate his importance, now
believed that he was in a position to crush these presumptuous
burghers once and for all. With a splendidly equipped army of
some fifty thousand men, and some of the new heavy artillery
that had already begun to turn battle-fields into an inferno,
he crossed the Jura mountains and marched towards the town of
Granson, that had been occupied by the Swiss. This he speedily
reduced, hanging the entire garrison on the trees without the
gates as an indication of how he intended to deal with rebels,
and then continued on his way, since he heard that the army of
the Cantons, some eighteen thousand men in all, had gathered
in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>On the slopes of a vineyard he could soon see their vanguard,
kneeling with arms outstretched. ‘These cowards are ours,’ he
exclaimed contemptuously, and at once ordered his artillery
to fire; for he thought that the peasants begged for mercy,
whereas, believing God was on their side, they really knelt
in prayer. Mown down in scores, the Swiss maintained their
ground; and Charles, to tempt them from their strong position,
ordered a part of his army to fall back as if in rout. This ruse
his own Burgundians misunderstood, the more that at the
moment they received the command they could see the main
Swiss forces advancing rapidly across the opposite heights and
blowing their famous war-horns. Confusion ensued, and soon,
in the words of an old Swiss chronicler, ‘the Burgundians took
to their heels and disappeared from sight as though a whirlwind
had swept them from the earth.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
Such was the unexpected victory of Granson, that delivered
into Swiss hands the silken tents and baggage-wagons of the
richest and most luxurious ruler in Europe. Carpets and
Flemish lace, fine linen and jewellery, embroidered banners,
beautifully chased and engraved weapons: these were some of
the treasures, of which specimens are still to be found in the
museums of the Cantons.</p>

<p>Charles was defeated, ‘overcome by rustics whom there would
have been no honour in conquering,’ as the King of Hungary
expressed the situation in the knightly language of the day.
Such a disgrace intensified Burgundian determination to continue
the war; while the Swiss on their part found their
resolution hardened by the sight of the garrison of Granson
hanging from the trees.</p>

<p>‘There are three times as many of the foe as at Granson, but
let no one be dismayed. With God’s help we will kill them all.’
Thus spoke a Swiss leader on the eve of the battle of Morat,
where savage hand-to-hand fighting reduced the Burgundian
infantry to a fragment and drove the Duke with a few horsemen
in headlong flight from the field.</p>

<p>Twice defeated, a wise prince might have done well to consider
terms of peace with those who, though rustics, had
proved more than his equals; but Charles, a brave soldier,
would not recognize that his own bad generalship had largely
contributed to his disasters. He chose to believe instead in that
convenient but somewhat thin excuse for failure, ‘bad luck’, and
prophesied that his fortune would turn if he persevered.</p>

<p>More dubious of their ruler’s ability than his fortune, the
Flemings, as they grudgingly voted money for a fresh campaign,
besought their Duke to make peace. His former allies, once
dazzled by his name and riches, were planning to desert him: but
Charles was deaf alike to hints of prudence or tales of treachery.</p>

<p>Near the town of Nanci he met the Swiss for a third time, and
once more the famous horns, ‘the bull’ of Uri and ‘the cow’ of
Unterwalden, bellowed forth their calls to victory, and the
Burgundians, inspired by treachery or forebodings of defeat,
turned and fled. None knew what had happened to the Duke,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
until a captured page reported that he had seen him cut down as
he fought stubbornly against great numbers. Later his body
was discovered, stripped for the sake of its rich armour, and
half-embedded in a frozen lake.</p>

<p>Thus fittingly died Charles ‘the Rash’, leaving the reputation
as a warrior that he would gladly have earned to his enemies the
Swiss, now regarded as amongst the invincible veterans of Europe.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The voice of freedom had spoken so loudly through the
Forest Cantons that mediaeval Europe had been forced to
acknowledge her claim, and elsewhere also democratic forces
were openly at work. We have spoken in previous chapters
of the ‘Communes’ of northern France and Italy, precocious in
their civilization, modern in their demands for self-government.
In Italy, at least, they had been strong enough to form Leagues
and defeat Emperors; but commercial jealousy and class feuds
had always prevented these Unions from developing into a
federation.</p>

<p>This is true also of southern Germany, where towns like
Augsburg and Nuremburg become, as the central mart for
trade between Eastern and Western Europe and also between
Venice, Genoa, and the lands north of the Alps, rivals in wealth
and luxury of Mediterranean ports. During periods like the
‘Great Interregnum’, when German kingship was of no avail to
preserve peace or order, it was associations of these towns that
sent out young burghers to fight the robber knights that were
the pest of the countryside, and to protect the merchandise on
which their joint fortunes depended.</p>

<p>Union for obvious purposes of defence was thus a political
weapon forged early in town annals; but, on the other hand, it
was only slowly that burghers and citizens came to realize the
advantages of permanent combination for other ends, such as
commercial expansion, or in order to secure stable government.</p>

<p>This limited outlook arose partly from the very different
stages of development at which mediaeval towns were to be found
at the same moment. Some would be just struggling out of dependence
on a local bishop or count by the payment of huge tolls,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
at the same time that others, though enjoying a good deal of commercial
freedom, were still forced to accept magistrates appointed
by their neighbouring overlord. Yet again, a privileged few
would be ‘free’ towns, entirely self-governed, and owning
allegiance only to the Emperor. Perhaps a master mind could
have dovetailed all these conflicting systems of government into
a federation that would have helped and safeguarded the
interests of all, but unfortunately the mediaeval mind was a slave
to the fallacy that commercial gain can only be made at the expense
of some one else.</p>

<p>The men of one town hated and feared the prosperity of
another and were convinced that the utmost limit of duty to
a neighbour was their own city walls. Nothing, for instance,
is more opposed to modern codes of brotherhood than the early
mediaeval opinion on the subjects of wrecks. Men and women of
those days saw no incongruity in piously petitioning God in
public prayer for a good wreckage, or in regarding the shipwrecked
sailor or merchant cast on their rocks as prey to be
knocked on the head and plucked.</p>

<p>The towns of North Germany shared to the full this primitive
savagery, but they learned the secret of co-operation that their
wealthy southern neighbours utterly missed, and in so doing
became for a time a political force of world-wide fame.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ‘Hansa’</div>

<p>Such was the commercial league of ‘the Hansa’, formed
first of all by a few principal ports, Lübeck, Danzig, Bremen,
and Hamburg, lying on the Baltic or North Sea, but afterwards
increased to a union of eighty or more towns as the value of
mutual support and obligations was realized.</p>

<p>Law in the Middle Ages was personal rather than territorial&mdash;that
is to say, a man when he travelled abroad would not be
judged or protected by the law of the country to which he went,
but would carry his own law with him. If this law was practically
non-existent, as for a German during years of anarchy when the
Holy Roman Empire was thoroughly discredited in the eyes of
Europe, the merchant stood a small chance of safeguarding
himself and his wares.</p>

<p>It was here, when emperors and kings of the Romans failed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
that the Hanseatic League stepped in, maintaining centres in
foreign towns where the merchants of those cities included in
the League could lodge and store their goods, and where
permanent representatives of the League could make suit to the
government of the country on behalf of fellow merchants who
had suffered from robbery or violence.</p>

<p>As early as the tenth century German traders had won
privileges in English markets, for we find in the code of
Ethelred ‘the Rede-less’ the following statement: ‘The people of
the Emperor have been judged worthy of good laws like ourselves.’</p>

<p>Later, ‘steelyards,’ or depots somewhat similar to the Flemish
‘staple-towns’, were established for the convenience of imperial
merchants; and owing to the energy of the Hanseatic League
these became thriving centres of commerce, respected by kings
of England if jealously disliked by their subjects.</p>

<p>Protection of the merchants belonging to ‘the Hansa’ while in
foreign countries soon represented, however, but a small part of
the League’s duty towards those who claimed her privileges.
The merchant must travel safely to his market by land and sea;
but in North Germany he had not merely to fear robber knights
but national foes: the hostile Slav tribes that attacked him as he
rode eastwards to the famous Russian market of Nijni-Novgorod
to negotiate for furs, tallow, and fats: or even more dangerous
Scandinavian pirates who sought to sink his vessel as he
crossed the Baltic or threaded the Danish isles.</p>

<p>One of the chief sources of Hanse riches was the fishing
industry, since the law that every Christian must abstain from
meat during the forty days of Lent, and on the weekly Friday
fast, made fish a necessity of life even more in the Middle Ages
than in modern times. Now the cheapest of all fish for anxious
housekeepers was the salted herring, and as the herring migrated
from one ocean-field to another it made and unmade the fortune
of cities. From the middle of the twelfth to the middle of the
fifteenth century it chose the Baltic as a home of refuge from
the North Sea whales, and in doing so built the prosperity of
Lübeck, just as it broke that prosperity when it swam away
to the coasts of Holland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
For two months every year the North German fishermen cast
nets for their prey as it swept in millions through the narrow
straits past the coast of Skaania; but here lay trouble for ‘the
Hansa’, since Skaania, one of the southernmost districts of
modern Sweden, was then a Danish province, and the Danes,
who were warriors rather than traders, hated the Germans
heartily.</p>

<div id="ip_287" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">

  <div class="caption"><p>N.E. EUROPE<br />
  in the MIDDLE AGES</p></div></div>

<p>In early mediaeval times we have noticed Scandinavia as
the home of Norse pirates; as the mother of a race of world-conquerors,
the Normans; under Cnut, who reigned in England,
Norway, and Denmark, as an empire-builder. The last ideal
was never quite forgotten, for as late as the Hundred Years’
War King Valdemar III of Denmark planned to aid his French
ally by invading England; but the necessary money was not
forthcoming, and other and more pressing political problems
intervened and stopped him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>
Valdemar inherited from his Norse ancestors a taste for
piracy that he pursued with a restless, unscrupulous energy very
tiring to his people. Sometimes it brought him victory, but more
often disaster, at least to his land. ‘In the whole kingdom’,
says a discontented Dane, ‘no time remained to eat, to repose,
to sleep&mdash;no time in which people were not driven to work by
the bailiffs and servants of the King at the risk of losing his
royal favour, their lives, and their goods.’ Because of his persistence
Valdemar was nicknamed ‘Atterdag’, or ‘There is
another day’: his boast being that there was always time to
return to any task on completing which he had set his heart.</p>

<p>Valdemar’s chief ambition was to make Denmark the supreme
power in northern Europe, and in endeavouring to achieve this
object he was always forming alliances with Norway and Sweden
that broke down and plunged him into wars instead. The Hanse
towns he hated and despised, and in 1361, moved by this enmity,
he promised his army that ‘he would lead them whither there
was gold and silver enough, and where pigs ate out of silver
troughs’. His allusion was to Wisby, the capital of Gothland,
that under the fostering care and control of North German
merchants had become the prosperous centre of the Baltic
herring-fishery. Under Valdemar’s unexpected onslaught the
city, with its forty-eight towers rising from the sea, was set on
fire and sacked.</p>

<p>Since Gothland was a Swedish island, vengeance for this
insult did not legally rest with the Hansa, but, recognizing that
the blow had been aimed primarily at her trade, she sent a fleet
northwards to co-operate with the Swedes and Norwegians.
This led to one of the greatest disasters that ever befell the
Hanseatic League, for her allies did not appear, and her fleet,
being outnumbered, was beaten and destroyed.</p>

<p>Valdemar, delighted with his success, determined to reduce
the North Germans to ruin, and continued his policy of aggression
with added zest; but in this he made a political mistake.
Many of the towns, especially those not on the Baltic, were
apathetic when the struggle with the Danish king began: they
did not wish to pay taxes even for a victory, and angrily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
repudiated financial responsibility for defeat. It was only as
they became aware, through constant Danish attacks, that the
very existence of the League was at stake, that a new public
opinion was born, and that it was decided at Cologne in 1367
to reopen a campaign against King Valdemar, towards which
every town must contribute its due.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘If any city refuse to help’, ran the announcement of the
meeting’s decisions, ‘its burghers and merchants shall have no
intercourse with the towns of the German “Hansa”, no goods
shall be bought from them or sold to them, they shall have no
right of entry or exit, of lading or unlading, in any harbour.’</p></blockquote>

<p>The result of the League’s vigorous policy was entirely
successful, and compelled the unscrupulous Valdemar, who found
himself shortly in an awkward corner, to collect all the money
that he could and depart on a round of visits to the various courts
of Europe. He left his people to the fate he had prepared for
them, and during his absence Copenhagen was sacked, and the
Danes driven to conclude the Treaty of Stralsund that placed
the League in control of all the fortresses along the coast of
Skaania for fifteen years.</p>

<p>The Hansa had now acquired the supremacy of the Baltic,
and because the duty of garrisoning fortresses and patrolling the
seas required a standing army and navy, the League of northern
towns did not, like those in South Germany, Italy, or France,
melt away as soon as temporary safety was achieved. Each
city continued to manage its own affairs, but federal assemblies
were held, where questions of common taxation and foreign
policy were discussed, and where those towns that refused to
abide by decisions previously arrived at were ‘unhansed’, that
is, deprived of their privileges.</p>

<p>Even Emperors, who condemned leagues on principle from
old Hohenstaufen experience, respected if they disliked ‘the
Hansa’ that carried through national police-work in the north
of which they themselves were quite incapable.</p>

<p>The Emperor Charles IV, when he visited Lübeck, addressed
the principal civic officials as ‘My lords!’ and when, suspicious
of this flattery, they demurred, he replied, ‘You are lords indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
for the oldest imperial registers know that Lübeck is one of the
five towns that have accorded to them ducal rank in the imperial
council.’ The chronicler adds proudly that thus Lübeck was
acknowledged the equal of Rome, Venice, Florence, and Pisa.</p>

<p>In the latter half of the fourteenth century the Hanseatic
League stood at the height of its power; for though the political
genius of Queen Margaret, daughter of Valdemar III, succeeded
in uniting Denmark, Norway, and Sweden by the agreement
called ‘the Union of Kalmar’, and also forced the Hansa to
surrender the fortresses on the Skaania coast; yet even the
foundation of this vast Scandinavian Empire could not shake
German supremacy over the Baltic. Under Margaret’s successors
the Union of Kalmar degenerated into a Danish tyranny;
and because it was the result of a dynastic settlement and not of
any national movement it soon came to shipwreck amid general
discontent and civil wars.</p>

<p>The Hanseatic League itself, though it lingered on as a
political force through the fifteenth century, gradually declined
and lost touch with the commercial outlook of the age. The decline
may be traced partly to the fact that there was no vigorous
national life in Germany to feed the League’s vitality, but also to
a steady tendency for towns to drift apart and become absorbed
in the local interests of their provinces.</p>

<p>The real blow to the prestige of the League was, however, the
departure of the herring-shoals from the Baltic to the coasts of
Amsterdam. ‘The Hansa’ had concentrated its commercial
interests in the Baltic, and when the Baltic failed her she found
herself unable to compete with the Dutch and English traders,
who were already masters of the North Sea.</p>

<p>Other and more adventurous rivals were opening up trade
routes along the African coast and across the Atlantic; but the
Hanseatic League, with her rigid and limited conception of commercial
interests, was like a nurse still holding by the hand
children that should have been able to fend for themselves.
Once the protection of her merchants, she had degenerated into
a check on individual enterprise, and so, belonging to the spirit
of the Middle Ages, with the Middle Ages passed away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Teutonic Knights</div>

<p>Another mediaeval institution, destined also to decline and
finally vanish, was a close ally of the Hanseatic League,
namely, the Order of Teutonic Knights. Transferred, as we
have noticed,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> on the fall of the Latin Empire in Asia Minor
to the shores of the Baltic, the Order had there justified its
existence by carrying on a perpetual war against the heathen
Lithuanians and Prussians, building fortresses and planting
colonies of German settlers, as Charlemagne and his Franks
had set the example.</p>

<p>While there still remained heathen to conquer the Knights
were warmly encouraged by the Pope, and their battle-fields
were a popular resort for the chivalry of nearly every country in
Europe, competing in their claim with the camps of Valencia,
Murcia, and Granada.</p>

<p>Nearer home the Order found less favour. In Poland, for
instance, that had at first welcomed the Knights as a bulwark
against northern barbarism, the unpleasant knowledge gradually
dawned that the crusaders, by securing the territory of Livonia,
Curland, and Prussia, had cut her off from a lucrative sea-trade.</p>

<p>Poland was the most easterly of those states that in mediaeval
times owned a nominal allegiance to Holy Roman Emperors.
She had received her Christianity from Rome, and was thus
drawn into the network of western life&mdash;unlike Russia, or the
kingdom of Rus as it was called, that was converted by missionaries
from Constantinople, and whose princes and dukes were
subject to Mongol overlords in Siberia from the middle of the
thirteenth to the middle of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>The Poles were brave, intensely devoted to their race,
persistent in their enmities, and in none more than in their
dislike of the German Knights, whose military genius and discipline
had so often thwarted their ambitions. Quarrels and
wars were continuous, but the most mortal wound dealt by the
Poles was the result not of a victory but of a marriage alliance.</p>

<p>In 1387, soon after the death of Louis ‘the Great’, who had
been King of both Hungary and Poland, the Poles offered their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
crown to Duke Jagello of Lithuania; on the condition that he
would marry one of Louis’s daughters and become a Christian.
The temptation of a kingdom soon overcame Jagello’s religious
scruples, so that he cast away his old gods and was baptized as
Ladislas V, becoming the founder of the Jagellan dynasty, that
continued on the thrones of Poland and Lithuania right through
the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The conversion of the Lithuanians, who, whatever their beliefs,
were driven at the spear-point to accept Jagello’s new faith, completely
undermined the position of the Teutonic Order that, surrounded
by Christian neighbours, had no longer a crusade to
justify its claims. Popes ceased to send their blessing to the
Grand Master, and talked instead of the possibilities of suppression;
while tales of immorality and avarice such as had pursued
the Templars were everywhere whispered into willing ears.</p>

<p>Within their own territory also the influence of the Knights
was waning; for the very nature of their vows made their rule
merely a military domination; and, once the fear of heathen
invasion had been removed, German colonists began to resent
this. Condemned to celibacy, the Knights could train up no
hereditary successors in sympathy from childhood with the needs
of the Baltic province; but, as they grew old and died, they must
yield place instead to recruits from distant parts of Germany, who
could only learn anew by their own experience the manners
and traditions of those whom they governed.</p>

<p>In the stress of these new conditions the good work that the
Teutonic Order had done in saving North Germany from
barbarism was forgotten. Weakened by disaffection within her
own state, she fell an inevitable victim to Polish enmity, and at
the battle of Tannenberg her Grand Master and many of her
leading Knights were slain. The daring and determination of
those who remained prevented the full fruits of this victory from
being reaped until 1466, when, by the Treaty of Thorn, Poland
received the whole of western Prussia, including the important
town of Danzig, that gave her the long-coveted control of the
Vistula and a Baltic seaport, beside hemming her enemies into
the narrow strip of eastern Prussia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Louis ‘the Great’</div>

<p>Poland’s southern neighbour was the kingdom of Hungary,
with which she had been for a short time united under Louis
‘the Great’, ‘the Banner-bearer of the Church’ as he was styled
by a grateful Pope for his victories over the Mahometans.
Besides fighting against the Turks, Louis had other military
irons in the fire. One of his ambitions was to dominate Eastern
Europe, and with this object he was continually attacking and
weakening the Serbian Empire, that appeared likely to be his
chief rival. He also fought with the Venetians for the mastery
of the Dalmatian coast, while we shall see in a later chapter that
he aimed at becoming King of Naples on the murder of his
brother Prince Andrew, husband of Joanna I.</p>

<p>So successful was Louis in his war against the Venetians that
he was able to take from them Dalmatia and exact the promise
of a large yearly tribute. This in itself was achievement enough
to win him a reputation in Europe, for the ‘Queen of the Adriatic’
was a difficult foe to humble; but Louis also gained public
admiration by his enlightened rule. Recognizing how deeply
his land was scarred by racial feuds, such as those of the Czechs
and Magyars, that have carried their bitterness far into modern
times, he set himself to think out equitable laws, which he endeavoured
to administer with impartial justice, instead of favouring
one race at the expense of another. He also made his court a
centre of culture and learning, where his nobles might develop
their wits and manners as well as their sword-arms.</p>

<p>One of the chief supporters of Louis in this work of civilization
was the Emperor Charles IV, whom we have noticed paying compliments
to the citizens of Lübeck. The friendship lasted for
several years, until some of the princes of the Empire, weary of
Charles’s rule, began to compare the two monarchs, one so sluggish,
the other a military hero, and to suggest that the overlord
should be deposed in favour of the famous King of Hungary.
Louis indignantly repudiated this plot; but Charles, who would
hardly have done the same in a like case, could not bring himself
to believe him, and in his anger began petulantly to abuse the
Queen Mother of Hungary, to whom he knew her son was
devoted. This led to recriminations, and finally to a war, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
which Charles was so thoroughly beaten that he sued for peace;
and outward friendship was restored by the marriage of the
Emperor’s son, Sigismund of Luxemburg, with Louis’s daughter
Mary.</p>

<p>When Louis died, Poland, that had never wholeheartedly
submitted to his rule, gave itself, as we have seen, to King
Jagello of Lithuania; while the Hungarians, after some years of
anarchy, chose Sigismund of Luxemburg as their king.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The House of Luxemburg was in the later Middle Ages the
chief rival of the Habsburgs, and provided the Empire with some
of her most interesting rulers. One of these, the Emperor
Henry VII, belongs to an earlier date than that with which we
have just been dealing, for he was grandfather of Charles IV.
He was a gallant and chivalrous knight, who, but for his unfortunate
foreign policy, might have proved himself a good and
wise king.</p>

<p>Dante, the greatest of Italian poets, who lived in the days of
Henry VII, made him his hero, and hoped that he would save
the world by establishing a Ghibelline supremacy that would
reform both Church and State. It was Henry VII’s undoing
that he believed with Dante that he had been called to this
impossible mission; and so he crossed the Alps to try his hand
at settling Italian feuds. Germany saw him no more; for soon
after his coronation at Rome he fell ill and died, poisoned, it is
said, in the cup of wine given him by a priest at Mass.</p>

<p>Discord now broke out in Germany, and it was not till 1348
that another of the House of Luxemburg was chosen King of
the Romans. This was Charles IV, a man of a very different type
of mind to his grandfather. For Charles Italy had no lure: he
only crossed the Alps because he realized that it increased the
prestige of the ruler of Germany to be crowned as Emperor by
the Pope, and he did not mind at all that he was received without
any pomp or respect, only with suspicion and begging
demands. As soon as the ceremony was over he hastened back
to his own kingdom, turning a deaf ear to all Italian complaints
and suggestions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
This hurried journey was certainly undignified for a world-Emperor;
but Charles, who had run away in his youth from the
battle-field of Creci, was never a heroic figure. Neither the
thought of glory nor of duty could stir his sluggish blood; but
as far as obvious things were concerned he had a good deal of
common sense. At any rate, in sharing Rudolf I’s conviction
that Germany should come first in his thoughts he was wiser
than his heroic grandfather.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Golden Bull</div>

<p>To the reign of Charles IV belongs the ‘Golden Bull’, a
document so called from its <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">bulla</i> or seal. The ‘Golden Bull’
set forth clearly the exact method of holding an imperial election.
Hitherto much of the trouble in disputed elections had arisen
because no one had been sure of the correct procedure, and so
disappointed candidates, by arguing that something illegal had
occurred, were able to refuse allegiance to the successful nominee.
Now it was decided that there should be seven Electors&mdash;three
archbishops and four laymen&mdash;and that the ceremony should
always take place at Frankfort, the minority agreeing to be bound
by the will of the majority.</p>

<p>Besides these main clauses the ‘Golden Bull’ secured to the
seven Electors enormous privileges and rights of jurisdiction,
thus raising them to a much higher social and political level than
the other princes of Germany, who were merely represented in
the Imperial Diet or Parliament. The Electors became, in
fact, more influential than the Emperor himself, and Charles
has often been blamed for handing over Germany to a feudal
oligarchy.</p>

<p>It is possible that he did not foresee the full results or
permanence of the ‘Golden Bull’, but was determined only to
construct for the time being a workable scheme that would
prevent anarchy. There is also the supposition that he was more
interested in the position of the kingdom of Bohemia, his own
hereditary possession, which he raised to the first place among
the electing territories, than in the rôle of Emperor to which he
had been chosen. Whatever Charles’s real motive, it is at any
rate clear that he had the sense to see that the Empire as it
stood was an outworn institution, and thus to try and mould it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
into a less fantastic form of government. Like Edward I of
England and Philip IV of France, though without the genius
of the one or the opportunities of the other, he stands for
posterity as one of those rulers of Europe during whose reign
their country was enabled to shake off some of its mediaeval
characteristics. Charles wore the imperial crown longer than
any of his predecessors without arousing serious opposition&mdash;a
sign that, if not an original politician, he yet moved with his
times towards a more Modern Age.</p>

<span class="subhead">ITALY IN THE LATER MIDDLE AGES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When the ‘Company of Death’ repulsed the German army
of Frederick Barbarossa on the field of Legnano<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> it raised
aloft before the eyes of Europe not only the banner of democracy
but also of nationality. Others, as we have seen, followed these
banners once displayed: the Swiss Cantons shook off the
Habsburg yoke: the Flemish towns defied their counts and
French overlords: the Hanse cities formed political as well as
commercial leagues against Scandinavia: France, England, and
Spain emerged, through war and anarchy, modern states
conscious of a national destiny.</p>

<p>This slow evolution of nations and classes is the history of the
later Middle Ages; but in Italy there is no steady progress to
record; rather, a retrogression that proves her early efforts to
secure freedom were little understood even by those who made
them.</p>

<p>Frederick II had ruled Lombardy in the thirteenth century
through tyrants; but, long after the Hohenstaufen had disappeared,
and the quarrels of Welfs and Waiblingen had
dwindled into a memory in Germany, the feuds of Guelfs and
Ghibellines were still a monstrous reality in towns south of the
Alps, where petty despots enslaved the Communes and reduced
the country to perpetual warfare.</p>

<p>At length from this welter of lost hopes and evil deeds there
emerged, not Italy a nation, but five Italian states of pre-eminence
in the peninsula, namely, Milan, Venice, Florence,
Naples, and Rome. Each was more jealous of the other than
of foreign intervention, so that on the slightest pretext one
would appeal to France to support her ambitions, another to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Spain or the Empire, and yet a third to Hungary or the Greeks.
If Italy, as a result, became at a later date ‘the cockpit of
Europe’, where strangers fought their battles and settled their
fortunes, it was largely her lack of any national foresight in
mediaeval times that brought on her this misery.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>ITALY<br />
  in the LATER MIDDLE AGES</p></div></div>

<p>The history of Milan, first as a Commune fighting for her
own liberty and destroying her neighbour’s, then as the battle-ground
of a struggle between two of her chief families, and finally
as the slave of the victor, is the tale of many a north Italian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>
town, only that position and wealth gave to the fate of this
famous city a more than local interest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Visconti</div>

<p>The lords of Milan in the fourteenth and early fifteenth
centuries were the Visconti, typical tyrants of the Italy of their
day, quick with their swords, but still more ready with poison or
a dagger, profligate and luxurious, patrons of literature and art,
bad enemies and still worse friends, false and cruel, subtle as the
serpent they so fittingly bore as an emblem. No bond but fear
compelled their subject’s loyalty, and deliberate cruelty to
inspire fear they had made a part of their system.</p>

<p>Bernabò Visconti permitted no one but himself to enjoy the
pleasures of the chase; but for this purpose he kept some five
thousand savage hounds fed on flesh, and into their kennels his
soldiers cast such hapless peasants as had accidentally killed
their lord’s game or dared to poach on his preserves.</p>

<p>No sense of the sanctity of an envoy’s person disturbed
this grim Visconti’s sense of humour, when he demanded of
messengers sent by the Pope with unpleasant tidings whether
they would rather drink or eat. As he put the question he
pointed towards the river, rushing in a torrent beneath the
bridge on which he stood, and the envoys, casting horrified eyes
in that direction, replied, ‘Sir, we will eat.’ ‘Eat this, then,’
said Bernabò sternly, handing them the papal letter with its
leaden seals and thick parchment, and before they left his
presence the whole had been consumed.</p>

<p>Galeazzo Visconti, an elder brother of Bernabò, bore an even
worse reputation for cruelty. Those he condemned to death
had their suffering prolonged on a deliberate programme during
forty-one days, losing now an eye, and now a foot or a hand,
were beaten, forced to swallow nauseous drinks, and then, when
the agony could be prolonged no further, broken on the wheel.
The scene of this torture was a scaffold set in the public gaze that
Milan might read what was the anger of the Visconti and
tremble.</p>

<p>The most famous of this infamous family was Gian Galeazzo,
son of Galeazzo, a youth so timid by nature that he would shake
and turn white at the sudden closing of a door, or at a noise in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
the street below. His uncle, Bernabò, believed him half-witted,
and foolishly accepted an invitation to visit him after his father’s
death, intending to manage the young man’s affairs for him
and to keep him in terrified submission. The wily old man was
to find himself outmatched, however, for Gian Galeazzo came to
their meeting-place with an armed guard, arrested his uncle,
and imprisoned him in a castle, where he died by slow poison.</p>

<p>After this Gian Galeazzo reigned alone in Milan, with no law
save his ruthless ambition; and by this and his skill in creating
political opportunities, and making use of them at his neighbour’s
expense, he succeeded in stretching his tyranny over the plains
of Lombardy and southwards amongst the hill cities of Tuscany.
Near at home he beat down resistance by force of arms, while
farther away he secured by bribery or fraud the allegiance of
cities too weak to stand alone, yet less afraid of distant Milan
than of Venice or Florence that lay nearer to their walls.</p>

<p>It was Gian Galeazzo’s aim to found a kingdom in North Italy,
and he went far towards realizing his project, stretching his
dominion at one time to Verona and Vicenza at the very gates
of Venice, while in the south he absorbed as subject-towns Pisa
and Siena, the two arch-enemies of Florence. This territory,
acquired by war, bribery, murder, and fraud, he persuaded the
Emperor to recognize as a duchy hereditary in his family, and
at once proceeded to form alliances with the royal houses of
Europe. The marriage of his daughter Valentina with the young
and weak-minded Duke of Orleans, brother of the French king,
though hardly an attractive union for the bride, proved fraught
with importance for the whole of Italy, since at the very end
of the fifteenth century, Louis, Duke of Orleans, a grandson of
Valentina Visconti, succeeded to the French crown as Louis XII,
and also laid claim to the duchy of Milan, as a descendant of
the Visconti.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>At first sight it seems strange that any race so cruel and
unprincipled as the Visconti should continue to maintain their
tyranny over men and women naturally independent like the
inhabitants of North Italy. Certainly, if their rulers had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
forced to rely on municipal levies they would not have kept their
power even for a generation; but unfortunately the old plan of
expecting every citizen of military age to appear at the sound of
a bell in order to defend his town had practically disappeared.
Instead the professional soldier had taken the citizen’s place&mdash;the
type of man who, as long as he received high wages and
frequent booty, did not care who was his master, nor to what
ugly job of carnage or intimidation he was bidden to bring his
sword.</p>

<p>This system of hiring soldiers, <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">condottieri</i>, as they were called
in Italy, had arisen partly from the laziness of the townsmen
themselves, who did not wish to leave their business in order to
drill and fight, and were therefore quite willing to pay volunteers
to serve instead of them. Partly it was due to the reluctance
of tyrants to arm and employ as soldiers the people over whom
they ruled. From the point of view of the Visconti, for instance,
it was much safer to enrol strangers who would not have any
patriotic scruples in carrying out a massacre, or any other orders
equally harsh.</p>

<p>For such ruffians Italy herself supplied a wide recruiting-ground,
namely, the numberless small towns, once independent
but now swallowed up by bigger states, who treated the conquered
as perpetual enemies to be bullied and suppressed; allowing
them no share in the government nor voice in their future
destiny. Wide experience has taught the world that such
tyranny breeds merely hatred and disloyalty, and the continual
local warfare from which mediaeval Italy suffered could be largely
traced to the failure to recognize this political truth. With no
legitimate outlet for their energies, the young men of the conquered
towns found in the formation of a company of adventurers,
or in the service of some prince, the only path to renown, possibly
a way of revenge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ‘Condottieri’ System</div>

<p>To Italian <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">condottieri</i> were added German soldiers whom
Emperors visiting Italy had brought in their train, and who afterwards
remained behind, looking on the cities of Italy as a happy
hunting-ground for loot and adventure. Yet a third source of
supply were freebooters from France, released by one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>
truces of the Hundred Years’ War, and hastily sent by those
who had employed them to seek their fortunes elsewhere.</p>

<p>Amongst those who came to Italy in the fourteenth century,
and built for himself a name of terror and renown, was an English
captain, Sir John Hawkwood, the son of an Essex tailor, knighted
by Edward III for his prowess on the battle-fields of France.
Here is what a Florentine chronicler says of him:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘He endured under arms longer than any one, for he endured
sixty years: and he well knew how to manage that there should
be little peace in Italy in his time.... For men and Communes
and all cities live by peace, but these men live and increase
by war, which is the undoing of cities, for they fight and become
of naught. In such men there is neither love nor faith.’</p></blockquote>

<p>One tale of the day records how some Franciscans, meeting
Sir John Hawkwood, exclaimed as was their custom, ‘Peace
be with you.’ To their astonishment he answered, ‘God take
away your alms.’ When they asked him the reason for wishing
them so ill, he replied, ‘You also wished that God might make
me die of hunger. Know you not that I live on war, and that
peace would ruin me? I therefore returned your greeting in
like sort.’</p>

<p>Sir John Hawkwood spent most of his time in the service
of Florence; and, whatever his cruelty and greed, he does not
seem to have been as false as other captains of his time. Indeed,
when he died, the Florentines buried him in their cathedral, and
raised an effigy in grateful memory of his deeds on behalf of
the city.</p>

<p>Returning to the history of Milan and her <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">condottieri</i>, Gian
Galeazzo, though timid and unwarlike himself, was a shrewd
judge of character, and his captains, while they struck terror
into his enemies, remained faithful to himself. When he died
in 1402, however, many of them tried to establish independent
states; and it was some years before his son, Filippo Maria,
could master them and regain control over the greater part of
the Duchy.</p>

<p>Even more cowardly than his father, Filippo Maria lived, like
Louis XI of France, shut off from the sight of men. Sismondi,
the historian, describes him as ‘a strange, dingy, creature, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
protruding eyeballs and furtive glance.’ He hated to hear the
word ‘death’ mentioned, and for fear of assassination would
change his bedroom every night. When news was brought him
of defeat he would tremble in the expectation that his <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">condottieri</i>
might desert him: when messengers arrived flushed with victory
he was scarcely less aghast, believing that the successful general
might become his rival.</p>

<p>Such was the penalty paid by despots, save by those of iron
nerve, in return for their luxury and power: the dread that the
most servile of <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">condottieri</i> might be bribed into a relentless
enemy, poison lurk in the seasoned dish or wine-cup, a dagger
pierce the strongest mesh of a steel tunic. So night and day
was the great Visconti haunted by fear, while his hired armies
forced Genoa to acknowledge his suzerainty, and plunged his
Duchy into rivalry with Venice along the line of the River Adige.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<div class="sidenote">Venice</div>

<p>The history of Venice differs in many ways from that of other
Italian states. Built on a network of islands that destined her
geographically for a great sea-power, she had looked from earliest
times not to territorial aggrandisement, but to commercial expansion
for the satisfaction of her ambitions. In this way she
had avoided the strife of feudal landowners, and even the Guelf
and Ghibelline factions that had reduced her neighbours to
slavery.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Italy the names of cities and states are bound
up with the histories of mediaeval families; Naples with the
quarrels of Hohenstaufen, Angevins, and Aragonese: Rome
with the Barons of the Campagna, the Orsini and Colonna:
Milan with the Visconti, and later with the Sforza: Florence
with the Medici: but in Venice the state was everything,
demanding of her sons and daughters not the startling qualities
and vices of the successful soldier of fortune, but obedience,
self-effacement, and hard work.</p>

<p>The Doge, or Duke, the chief magistrate of Venice, has been
compared to a king; but he was in reality merely a president
elected for life, and that by a system rendered as complicated
as possible in order to prevent wire-pulling. Once chosen and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
presented to the people with the old formula, ‘This is your
Doge an’ it please you!’ the new ruler of the city found himself
hedged about by a hundred constitutional checks, that compelled
him to act only on the well-considered advice of his six Ducal
Councillors, forbade him to raise any of his family to a public
office or to divest himself of a rank that he might with years
find more burdensome than pleasant. He was also made aware
that the respect with which his commands were received was
paid not to himself but to his office, and through his office to
Venice, a royal mistress before whom even a haughty aristocracy
willingly bent the knee.</p>

<p>In early days all important matters in Venice were decided
by a General Assembly of the people; but as the population
grew, this unwieldy body was replaced by a ‘Grand Council’
of leading citizens. In the early fourteenth century another
and still more important change was made, for the ranks of the
Grand Council were closed, and only members of those families
who had been in the habit of attending its meetings were allowed
to do so in future. Thus a privileged aristocracy was created,
and the majority of Venetians excluded from any share in their
government; but because this government aimed not at the
advantage of any particular family but of the whole state, people
forgave its despotic character. Even the famous Council of Ten
that, like the Court of Star Chamber under the Tudors, had
power to seize and examine citizens secretly, in the interests of
the state, was admired by the Venetians over whom it exerted its
sway, because of its reputation for even-handed justice, that
drew no distinctions between the son of a Doge, a merchant, or
a beggar. ‘The Venetian Republic’, says a modern writer on
mediaeval times, ‘was the one stable element in all North Italy,’
and this condition of political calm was the wonder and admiration
of contemporaries.</p>

<p>Sometimes to-day it seems difficult to admire mediaeval Venice
because of her selfishness and frank commercialism. She had
no sense of patriotism either towards Italy or Christendom;
witness the Fourth Crusade,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> where nothing but her insistent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
desire to protect her trading position in the East had influenced
her diplomacy.</p>

<p>This accusation of selfishness is true; but we must remember
that the word ‘patriotism’ has a much wider scope in modern
times than was possible to the limited outlook of the Middle
Ages. Venice might be unmoved by the words ‘Italy’ or
‘Christendom’, but the whole of her life and ideals was centred
in the word ‘Venice’. Her sailors and merchants, who laid the
foundations of her greatness, were no hired mercenaries, but
citizens willing to lay down their lives for the Republic who was
their mother and their queen. Thus narrowing the term
‘patriotism’, we see that of all the Italian Powers Venice alone
understood what the word meant, in that her sons and daughters
were willing to sacrifice as a matter of course not merely life but
family ambitions, class, and even individuality to the interests of
their state.</p>

<p>The ambitions of Venice were bound up with the shipping and
commerce that had gained for her the carrying-trade of the world.
To take, for example, the wool manufacture, of such vital interest
to English and Flemings, we find that at one time this depended
largely on Venetian merchants, who would carry sugar and spices
to England from the East, replace their cargo with wool, unload
this in its turn in the harbours of Flanders, and then laden with
bales of manufactured cloth return to dispose of them in Italian
markets.</p>

<p>Besides the carrying-trade, which depended on her neighbour’s
industry, Venice had her own manufactures such as silk and
glass; but in either case both her sailors and workmen found
one thing absolutely vital to their interests, namely, the command
of the Adriatic. Like the British Isles to-day, Venice could not
feed her thriving population from home-produce, and yet, with
enemies or pirates hiding along the Dalmatian coast, safety for
her richly-laden vessels passing to and fro could not be
guaranteed. These are some of the reasons why from earliest
times the Republic had embarked on an aggressive maritime
policy that brought her into clash with other Mediterranean
ports, and especially with Genoa, her rival in Eastern waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>
When, at the end of the Fourth Crusade, Venice forced
Constantinople to accept a Latin dynasty, she secured for herself
for the time being especial privileges in that world-market;
Genoa, who adopted the cause of the exiled Greeks, achieved
a signal triumph in her turn when in 1261 with her assistance
Michael Paleologus, a Greek general, restored the Byzantine
Empire amid public rejoicings.</p>

<p>Open warfare was now almost continuous between the
republics; there was street-fighting in Constantinople and in the
ports of Palestine, sea-battles off the Italian and Greek coasts,
encounters in which varying fortunes gave at first the mastery
of the Mediterranean to neither Venice nor Genoa, but which
disastrously weakened the whole resistance of Christendom to
the Mahometans.</p>

<p>At length in 1380 a decisive battle was fought off Chioggia,
one of the cities of the Venetian Lagoons, whither the Genoese
fleet, triumphant on the open seas, had taken up its quarters
determined to blockade the enemy into surrender. ‘Let us man
every vessel in Venice and go and fight the foe’, was the general
cry; and a popular leader, Pisani, imprisoned on account of his
share in a recent naval disaster, was released on the public
demand and made captain of the enterprise. ‘Long live Pisani!’
the citizens shouted in their joy, but their hero, true to the spirit
of Venice, answered them, ‘Venetians cry only, “Long live
St. Mark!”’</p>

<p>With the few ships and men at his disposal, Pisani recognized
that it was out of the question to lead a successful attack; but
he knew that if he could defer the issue there was a Venetian
fleet in the eastern Mediterranean which, learning his straits,
would return with all possible speed to his aid. He therefore
determined to force the enemy to remain where they were without
offering open battle, and this manœuvre he carried out with
great boldness and skill, sinking heavy vessels loaded with stones
in the channels that led to Chioggia, while placing his own fleet
across the main entrance to prevent Genoese reinforcements.
The blockaders were now blockaded; and through long winter
days and nights the rivals, worn out by their bitter vigil, starving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>
and short of ammunition, watched one another and searched the
horizon anxiously. At length a shout arose, for distant sails
had been sighted; then as the Venetian flag floated proudly into
view the shout of Pisani and his men became a song of triumph:
the Republic was saved. Venice was not only saved from ruin,
her future as Queen of the Adriatic was assured, for the Genoese
admiral was compelled to surrender, and his Republic to
acknowledge her rival’s supremacy of the seas.</p>

<p>The sea-policy of Venice was the inevitable result of her
geographical position; but as the centuries passed she developed
a much more debatable land-policy. Many mediaeval Venetians
declared that since land was the source of all political trouble,
therefore Venice should only maintain enough command over the
immediate mainland to secure the city from a surprise attack.
Others replied that such an argument was dictated by narrow-minded
prejudice, a point of view suitable to the days when
Lombardy had been divided amongst a number of weak city states,
but impracticable with powerful tyrants, such as the
Visconti, masters of North Italy. Unless Venice could secure
the territories lying at the foot of the Alps, and also a wide
stretch of eastern Lombardy, she would find that she had no
command over the passes in the mountains by means of which
she carried on her commerce with Germany and Austria.</p>

<p>The advocates of a land-empire policy received confirmation
of their warnings when in the early part of the fourteenth
century Mastino della Scala, lord of Vicenza, Padua, and Treviso,
attempted to levy taxes on Venetian goods passing through his
territories. The Republic, roused by what she considered an
insult to her commercial supremacy, promptly formed a league
with Milan and Florence against Mastino, and obtained Treviso
and other towns as the result of a victorious war.</p>

<p>This campaign might, of course, be called merely a part of
Venice’s commercial policy, defence not aggression; but later,
in 1423, the Florentines persuaded the Republic to join with
them in a war against the Visconti, declaring that they were
weary of struggling alone against such tyrants, and that if
Venice did not help them they would be compelled to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>
Filippo Maria ‘King of North Italy.’ The result of the war that
followed was a treaty securing Venice a temporary increase of
power on the mainland, and may be taken as the first decisive step
in her deliberate scheme of building up a land-empire in Italy.</p>

<p>Machiavelli, a student of politics in the sixteenth century, who
wrote a handbook of advice for rulers called <cite>The Prince</cite>, as well
as the history of Florence, his native city, declares that the decline
of the Venetians ‘dated from the time when they became
ambitious of conquests by land and of adopting the manners and
customs of the other states of Italy’. This may be true; but it
is doubtful whether the great Republic could have remained in
glorious isolation with the Visconti knocking at her gates.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<div class="sidenote">Florence</div>

<p>From Venice we must turn to Florence, which, by the
fifteenth century, emerged from petty rivalries as the first city
in Tuscany. Like Milan, Florence fell a prey to Guelfs and
Ghibellines; but these feuds, instead of becoming a family rivalry
between would-be despots, developed into a bitter class-war.</p>

<p>On the fall of Frederick II the Guelfs, who in Florence at
this date may be taken as representing the <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">populo grasso</i>, or rich
merchants, as opposed to the <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</i>, or nobles, succeeded in
driving the majority of their enemies out of the city. They then
remodelled the constitution in their own favour.</p>

<p>The chief power in the city was now the ‘Signory’, composed of
the ‘Gonfalonier of Justice’ and a number of ‘Priors’, representatives
of the <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">arti</i>, or guilds of lawyers, physicians, clothiers,
&amp;c.: to name but a few. No aristocrat might stand for any public
office unless he became a member of one of the guilds, and in
order to ensure that he did not merely write down his name on
their registers it was later enacted that every candidate for
office must show proof that he really worked at the trade of
the guild to which he claimed to belong.</p>

<p>Other and sterner measures of proscription followed with
successive generations. The noble who injured a citizen of
lesser rank, whether on purpose or by accident, was liable to
have his house levelled with the dust: the towers, from which
in old days his ancestors had poured boiling oil or stones upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
their rivals, were reduced by law to a height that could be
easily scaled; in the case of a riot no aristocrat, however
innocent his intentions, might have access to the streets.
The <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">grande</i> was, in fact, both in regard to politics and justice,
placed at such an obvious disadvantage that to ennoble an
ambitious enemy was a favourite Florentine method of rendering
him harmless.</p>

<p>The Guelf triumph of the thirteenth century did not, in spite of
its completeness, bring peace to Florence. New parties sprang
up; and the government in its efforts to keep clear of class or
family influence introduced so many complicated checks that
great injury was done to individual action, and all hope of
a steady policy removed. Members of the ‘Signory’, for
instance, served only for two months at a time: the twelve
‘Buonomini’, or ‘Good men’, elected to give them advice only
for six. What was most in contrast to the ideal of ‘the right
man for the right job’ was the practice of first making a list of
all citizens considered suitable to hold office, then putting the
names in a bag, and afterwards picking them out haphazard as
vacancies occurred. Even this precaution against favouritism&mdash;and,
one is inclined to add, also against efficiency&mdash;was checked
by another law, the summoning of a <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">parlamento</i> in cases of
emergency. This <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">parlamento</i> was an informal gathering of the
people collected by the ringing of a bell in the big square, where it
was then asked to decide whether a special committee should be
appointed with free power to alter the existing constitution.
Politicians argued that here in the last resort was a direct appeal
to the people, but in reality by placing armed men at the
entrances to the square a docile crowd could be manœuvred
at the mercy of any mob-orator set up by those behind the
scenes.</p>

<p>Power remained in Florence in the hands of the prosperous
burghers and merchants, and these in time developed their own
feuds under the names of ‘Whites’ and ‘Blacks’, adopted by
the partisans in a family quarrel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dante Alighieri</div>

<p>The greatest of Italian poets, Dante Alighieri, was a ‘White’,
and was exiled from his city in 1302 owing to the triumph of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>
rivals. When pardon was suggested on the payment of a large
sum of money, Dante, who had tried to serve his city faithfully,
refused to comply, feeling that this would be an open acknowledgement
of his guilt. ‘If another way can be found ... which
shall not taint Dante’s fame and honour’, he wrote proudly,
‘that way I will accept and with no reluctant steps ... but if
Florence is not to be entered by any such way never will I enter
Florence.’</p>

<p>Dante’s mental outlook was typical of mediaeval times in its
stern prejudices and hatreds, but it was also clearer and nobler
in its scope. An enthusiastic Ghibelline in politics, he believed
that it was the first duty of Holy Roman Emperors to exert their
authority over Italy, but this vision was not narrowed, as with
many Italians, into the mere hope of restoration to home and
power, with a sequel of revenge on private enemies. Dearer to
Dante than any personal ambitions was the desire for the
salvation of both Church and state from tyranny and corruption;
and this he believed could only be achieved by bestowing
supreme power on a world-emperor.</p>

<p>One attempt at reform had been made in 1294, when the
conclave of Cardinals, suddenly stung with the contrast between
the character of the Catholic Church and its professions, chose
as their Vicar a hermit noted for his privations and holy life.
Celestine V, as he was afterwards called, was a small man, pale
and feeble, with tousled hair and garments of sackcloth. When
a deputation of splendidly dressed cardinals came to find him, he
fled in terror, and it was almost by force that he was at last
persuaded to go with them and put on the pontifical robes. The
men and women who longed for reform now waited eagerly for
this new Pope’s mandates; but their expectations were doomed
to failure. Celestine V had neither the originality nor the
strength of will to withstand his change of fortunes. Terrified
by his surroundings, he became an easy prey to those who were
unscrupulous and ambitious, giving away benefices sometimes
twice over because he dared not refuse them to importunate
courtiers, and creating new cardinals almost as fast as he
was asked to do so. At last he was allowed to abdicate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
and hurried back to his cell, but only to be seized by his successor,
the fierce Boniface VIII,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> and shut up in a castle, where
he died.</p>

<p>Dante hated Boniface as a ruler who debased his spiritual
opportunities in order to obtain material rewards, but he had
hardly less scorn for Celestine V, who was given power to reform
the Church of Christ and ‘made the great refusal’. Reform, in
the Florentine’s eyes, could not be looked for from Rome, but,
when the Emperor Henry VII crossed the Alps,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> his hopes rose
high that here at last was the saviour of Italy, and it is probable
that at this time the poet wrote his political treatise called the <cite>De
Monarchia</cite>, embodying his views. He himself went out to meet
his champion, but Henry was not destined to be a second
Charlemagne or Otto the Great, and his death closed all
expectations built on his chivalrous character and ideals.</p>

<p>Dante’s greatest work is his long poem the <cite>Divina Commedia</cite>,
divided into three parts, the <cite>Inferno</cite>, the <cite>Purgatorio</cite>, and the
<cite>Paradiso</cite>. It tells how on Good Friday of the year of Jubilee
1300 the Florentine, meeting with the spirit of Virgil whom he had
chosen as his master, was led by him through the realms
of everlasting punishment and of penance, and from there was
borne by another guide, Beatrice, the idealized vision of a woman
he had loved on earth, up through the ‘Nine Heavens’ to the very
throne of God. As a summary of mediaeval theories as to the
life eternal, and also as the reflection of a fourteenth-century
mind on politics of the day, the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite> is indeed
an historical treasury as well as a masterpiece of Italian literature.
It is, however, a great deal more&mdash;the revelation of the development
of a human soul. Dante’s journey is told with a mastery
of atmosphere and detail that holds our imaginations to-day with
the sense of reality. It was obviously still more real to himself
and expresses the agonized endeavour of a soul, alive to the
corruption and nerve-weariness of the world around him, to find
the way of salvation, a pilgrimage crowned at last by the
realization of a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Civitas Dei</i> so supreme in its beauty and peace as
to surpass the prophecies of St. Augustine.</p>

<p>Dante himself did not live to fulfil his earthly dream of returning
to Florence, but died at Ravenna in 1321. On his tomb is
an inscription in Latin containing the words, ‘Whom Florence
bore, the mother that did little love him’; while his portrait has
the proud motto so typical of his whole life, ‘I yield not to
misfortune’. In later centuries Florence recalled with shame her
repudiation of this the greatest of her sons; but while he lived,
and for some years after his death, political prejudices blinded
her eyes. In the Emperor Henry VII, to whom Dante referred
as ‘King of the earth and servant of God’, Florence saw an
enemy so hateful that she was willing to forgo her boasted
democracy, and to accept as master any prince powerful enough
to oppose him. Thus she granted the <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Signoria</i>, or ‘overlordship’
of the city, for five years to King Robert of Naples, the head of
the Guelf party in Italy during the early years of the fourteenth
century.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<div class="sidenote">Naples</div>

<p>King Robert of Naples was a grandson of Charles, Count
of Anjou, brother of St. Louis, and, true to the tradition of his
house, stood as the champion of the Popes against imperial
claims over Italy. Outwardly he was by far the most powerful
of the Italian princes of his day; but in reality he sat uneasily
on his throne. The Neapolitans had not learned with time
to love their Angevin rulers, but even after the death of Conradin
remembered the Hohenstaufen, and envied Sicily that dared to
throw off the French yoke and give herself to a Spanish
dynasty.</p>

<p>It is difficult to provide a short and at the same time connected
account of the history of Naples from the death of King Robert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>
in 1343 until 1435, when it was conquered by the House of
Aragon. For nearly a century there is a dismal record of murders
and plots, with scarcely an illuminating glimpse of patriotism or
of any heroic figure. It is like a ‘dance of death’, with ever-changing
partners, and nothing achieved save crimes and
revolutions.</p>

<p>King Robert’s successor was a granddaughter, Joanna I,
a political personage from her cradle, and married at the age of
five to a boy cousin two years her senior, Andrew of Hungary,
brother of Louis the Great. We cannot tell if, left to themselves,
this young couple, each partner so passionate and self-willed,
could have learned to work together in double harness. What
is certain is that no one in that corrupt court gave them the
chance, one party of intriguers continually whispering in Joanna’s
ear that as queen it was beneath her dignity to accept any interference
from her husband, while their rivals reminded the young
Prince Andrew that he was descended from King Robert’s
elder brother, and therefore had as great a right to the throne as
his wife. Frequent quarrels as to whose will should prevail shook
the council-chamber, and then at last came tragedy.</p>

<p>In 1345 Joanna and Andrew, then respectively eighteen and
twenty, set out together into the country on an apparently
amicable hunting-expedition. As they slept one night in the
guest-room of a convent the Prince heard himself called by
voices in the next room. Suspecting no harm he rose and went
to see which of his friends had summoned him, only to find himself
attacked by a group of armed men. He turned to re-enter
the bedroom, but the door was locked behind him. With the
odds now wholly against him, Andrew fought bravely for his life,
but at length two of his assassins succeeded in throwing a rope
round his neck, and with this they strangled him and hung his
body from the balcony outside.</p>

<p>Attendants came at last, and, forcing the door, told Joanna of
the murder; on which she declared that she had been so soundly
asleep that she had heard nothing, though she was never able
to explain satisfactorily how in that case the door of her bedroom
had become locked behind the young king. Naturally the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
greater part of Europe believed that she was guilty of connivance
in the crime, and King Louis of Hungary brought an army to
Italy to avenge his brother’s death. He succeeded in driving
Joanna from Naples, which he claimed as his rightful inheritance,
but he was not sufficiently supported to make a permanent
conquest, and in the end he was forced to hurry away to
Hungary, where his throne was threatened, leaving the question
of his sister-in-law’s guilt to be decided by the Pope.</p>

<p>The Pope at this time looked to the Angevin rulers of Naples
as his chief supporters, and at once proclaimed Joanna innocent.
It is worthy of note that three princes were found brave enough
to become her husband in turn; but, though four times married,
Joanna had but one son, who died as a boy.</p>

<p>At first she was quite willing to accept as her heir a cousin,
Charles of Durazzo, who was married to her niece, but soon she
had quarrelled violently with him and offered the throne instead
to a member of the French royal house, Louis, Duke of Anjou.
This is a very bewildering moment for students of history, because
it introduces into Italian politics a second Angevin dynasty only
distantly connected with the first, yet both laying claim to
Naples and waging war against one another as if each belonged
to a different race.</p>

<p>Joanna in the end was punished for her capriciousness, for in
the course of the civil wars she had introduced she fell into the
hands of Charles of Durazzo, who, indignant at his repudiation,
shut her up in a castle, where she died. One report says that
she was smothered with a feather-bed; another that she was
strangled with a silken cord&mdash;perhaps in memory of Prince
Andrew’s murder.</p>

<p>After this act of retribution, Charles of Durazzo maintained
his power in Naples for four years, though he was forced to
surrender the County of Provence to his Angevin rival. Not
content with his Italian kingdom, he set off with an army to
Hungary as soon as he heard of the death of Louis the Great,
hoping to enforce his claims on that warrior’s lands. Instead
he was assassinated, and succeeded in Naples by his son
Ladislas, a youth of fifteen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>
Ladislas proved a born soldier of unflagging energy and
purpose, so that he not only conquered his unruly baronage but
made himself master of southern Italy, including Rome, from
which with unusual Angevin hostility he drove the Pope. Here
was a chance for bringing about the union of Italy under one
ruler, and Ladislas certainly aimed at such an achievement, but
apart from his military genius he was a typical despot of his
day&mdash;cruel, unscrupulous, and pleasure-seeking as the Visconti&mdash;and
when he died, still a young man, in 1414 few mourned his
passing.</p>

<p>His sister, Joanna II, who succeeded him, lacked his strength
while exhibiting many of his vices. Like Joanna I she was
false and fickle; like Joanna I she had no direct heirs, so that
the original House of Anjou in Naples came to an end when
she died. Many negotiations as to her successor took place
during the latter years of her reign, and for some time it seemed
as if the old queen would be content to accept Louis III of
Anjou, at this time the representative of the Second Angevin
House, but in a moment of caprice and anger she suddenly
bestowed her favour instead on Alfonso V of Aragon and Sicily,
and adopted him as her heir. Of course, being Joanna, she
again changed her mind; but, though Alfonso pretended to
accept his repudiation, the hard-headed Spaniard was not to be
turned so easily from an acquisition that would forward Aragonese
ambitions in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Directly Joanna II died, Alfonso appeared off Naples with
a fleet, and though he was taken prisoner in battle and sent as
a prisoner to Filippo Maria Visconti at Milan, he acted with
such diplomacy that he persuaded that despot, hitherto an ally
of the Angevins, that it was much safer for Milan to have
a Spanish rather than a French House reigning in Naples.
This was the beginning of a firm alliance between Milan and
Naples, for Alfonso, released from his captivity, succeeded in
establishing himself in ‘the Kingdom’, where withdrawing his
court from Aragon he founded a new capital that became
a centre for learned and cultured Italians as of old in the days
of Frederick II.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>
We have dealt now with four of the five principal Italian
states during the later Middle Ages. In Rome, to pick up the
political threads, we must go back to the effects of the removal
of the papal court to Avignon in 1308.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>From the point of view of the Popes themselves, many of
them Frenchmen by birth, there were considerable advantages
to be gained by this change&mdash;not only safety from the invasions
of Holy Roman Emperors aspiring to rule Italy, but also from
the turbulence of Roman citizens and barons of the Campagna.</p>

<p>Avignon was near enough to France to claim her king’s
protection, but far enough outside her boundaries to evade
obedience to her laws. It stood in the County of Provence, part
of the French estates of the Angevin House of Naples, but during
her exile Joanna I, penniless and in need of papal support,
was induced to sell the city, and it remained an independent
possession of the Holy See until the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>From the immediate advantages caused by the ‘Babylonish
Captivity’, as these years of papal residence in Avignon were
called, we turn to the ultimate disadvantages, and these were
serious. Inevitably there was a lowering of papal prestige in
the eyes of Europe. In Rome, that since classic times had been
the recognized capital of the Western world, the Pope had
seemed indeed a world-wide potentate, on whom the mantle both
of St. Peter and of the Caesars might well have fallen. Transferred
to a city of Provence he shrank almost to the measure of
a petty sovereign.</p>

<p>During the Hundred Years’ War, for instance, there was
widespread grumbling in England at the obedience owed to
Avignon. The Popes, ran popular complaint, were more than
half French in political outlook and sympathy, so that an Englishman
who wished for a successful decision to his suit in a papal
law-court must pay double the sums proffered by men of any
other race in order to obtain justice. What was more, he knew
that any money he sent to the papal treasury helped to provide
the sinews of war for his most hated enemies.</p>

<p>The Papacy had been disliked across the Channel in the days<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
of Innocent IV, when England was taxed to pay for wars against
the Hohenstaufen: now, more than a century later, grumbling
had begun to crystallize in the dangerous shape of a resistance
not merely to papal supremacy, but to papal doctrine on which
that supremacy was based. Thus Wycliffe, the first great English
heretic, who began to proclaim his views during the later years of
Edward III’s reign, was popularly regarded as a patriot, and his
sermons denouncing Catholic doctrine widely read and discussed.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth century it had been possible to suppress
heresy in Languedoc; but in the fourteenth century there were
no longer Popes like Innocent III who could persuade men to
fight the battles of Avignon, and so the practice of criticism and
independent thought grew, and by the fifteenth century many
of the doctrines taught by Wycliffe had spread across Europe
and found a home in Bohemia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rome</div>

<p>With the history of Bohemian heresy we shall deal later,
but, having treated its development as partly arising from the
change in papal fortunes, we must notice the effect of the
Babylonish Captivity on Rome herself, and this, indeed, was
disastrous.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘The absence of the Pope’, says Gregorovius, a modern
German historian, ‘left the nobility more unbridled than ever;
these hereditary Houses now regarded themselves as masters
of Rome left without her master. Their mercenaries encamped
on every road; travellers and pilgrims were robbed; places of
worship remained empty. The entire circumstances of the city
were reduced to a meaner level. No prince, nobleman, or envoy
of a foreign power, any longer made his appearance.... Vicars
replaced the cardinals absent from their titular churches, while
the Pope himself was represented in the Vatican, as by a shadow,
by some bishop of the neighbourhood, Nepi, Viterbo, or Orvieto.’</p></blockquote>

<p>The wealth and pomp that had made the papal court a source
of revenue to the Romans were transferred to Provence: the
Orsini and Colonna battled in the streets with no High Pontiff
to hold them in check. Only his agents remained, who were
there mainly to collect his rents and revenues, so that the city
seemed once again threatened with political extinction as when
Constantine had removed his capital to the Bosporus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cola di Rienzi</div>

<p>One short period of glory there was in seventy years of gloom&mdash;the
realized vision of a Roman, Cola di Rienzi, a youth of the
people, who, steeped in the writings of classical times, hoped to
bring back to the city the freedom and greatness of republican
days. From contemporary accounts Rienzi had a wonderful
personality, striking looks, and an eloquence that rarely failed
to move those who heard him. At Avignon, as a Roman envoy,
he gained papal consent to some measures earnestly desired at
Rome, and this success won him a large and enthusiastic following
amongst the citizens, who applauded all that he said, and
offered to uphold his ambitions with their swords.</p>

<p>The first step to the greatness of Rome was obviously to
restore order to her streets, and Rienzi therefore determined to
overthrow the nobles, who with their retainers were always
brawling, and above all the proud family of Colonna, one of
whom without any provocation had killed his younger brother
in a fit of rage.</p>

<p>The revolution took place in May 1347, when, with the Papal
Vicar standing at his side, and banners representing liberty,
justice, and peace floating above his head, Rienzi proclaimed
a new constitution to the populace, and invested himself as chief
magistrate with the title of ‘Tribune, Illustrious Redeemer of
the Holy Roman Republic’.</p>

<p>At first there was laughter amongst the Roman nobles when
they heard of this proclamation. ‘If the fool provokes me
further,’ exclaimed Stephen Colonna, the head of that powerful
clan, ‘I will throw him from the Capitol’; but his contempt was
turned to dismay when he heard that a citizen army was guarding
the bridges, and confining the aristocratic families to their houses.
In the end Stephen fled to his country estates, while the younger
members of his household came to terms with the Tribune, and
swore allegiance to the new Republic.</p>

<p>Rienzi was now triumphant, and his letters to all the rulers
of Europe announced that Rome had found peace and law, while
he exhorted the other cities of Italy to throw off the yoke of
tyrants and join a ‘national brotherhood’.</p>

<p>It would seem that Rienzi alone of his contemporaries saw a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span>
vision of a united Italy; but unfortunately the common sense
and balance that are necessary to secure the practical realization
of a visionary’s dreams were lacking. The Tribune was
undoubtedly great, but not great enough to stand success. The
child of peasants, he began to boast that he was really a son of
the Emperor Henry VII, and the pageantry that he had first
employed to dazzle the Romans grew more and more elaborate
as he himself became ensnared by a false sense of his own dignity.
Clad in a toga of white silk edged with a golden fringe, he would
ride through the streets on a white horse, amid a cavalcade of
horsemen splendidly equipped. In order to celebrate his accession
to power he instituted a festival, where, amid scenes of
lavish pomp, he was knighted in the Lateran with a golden girdle
and spurs, after bathing in the porphyry font in which tradition
declared that Constantine had been cleansed from leprosy.</p>

<p>The people, as is the way with crowds, clapped their hands
and shouted while the trumpets blew, and they scrambled for
the gold Rienzi’s servants threw broadcast; but long afterwards,
when they had forgotten the even-handed justice their Tribune
had secured them, they remembered his foolish extravagance
and display, and resented the taxes that he found it necessary to
impose in order to maintain his government and state.</p>

<p>The history of Rienzi’s later years is a tale of brilliant opportunities,
created in the first place by his genius, and then lost by
his timidity or lack of balance. On one occasion, when he learned
that the very nobles who had sworn on oath to uphold his constitution
were plotting its overthrow, he invited the leaders of
the conspiracy to a banquet, arrested them, and sent them under
guard to prison. The next morning the prison-bell tolled, and
the nobles within were led out apparently to the death their
treachery had richly deserved. At the last moment, however,
when each had given up hope, the Tribune came before the
scaffold, and, after a sermon on the forgiveness of sins, ordered
those who were condemned to be set free.</p>

<p>If he had wished to win their allegiance by this act of clemency
Rienzi had ill-judged his enemies. They had disliked him before
as a peasant upstart; now they hated him far more bitterly as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>
man who had been able to humble them in the public gaze,
believing, whether rightly or wrongly, that it was not forgiveness
but fear of the powerful families to which they belonged that had
finally moved him to mercy. From this moment the Orsini, the
Colonna, and their friends had but one object in life&mdash;to pull the
Tribune from his throne. By bribery and the spreading of false
rumours they set themselves to undermine his influence, telling
tales everywhere of his extravagance and luxury as contrasted
with the heavy taxes, until at last in 1354 a tumult broke out in
the city, and a mob collected that stormed the palace where
Rienzi lodged, shouting ‘Death to the Traitor!’ As the Tribune
attempted to escape he was seen against the flames of his burning
walls and cut down.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Catherine of Siena</div>

<p>With the fall of Rienzi died the idea of a restored and reformed
Italy through the medium of a Holy Roman Republic, just as
Dante’s hope of a new and more perfect Roman Empire had
been shattered by the death of Henry VII. Was there then
no hope for Italy in mediaeval minds? The next answer that
there was hope, indeed, came from Siena, one of the hill towns
not far south of Florence, and its author was a peasant girl,
Catherine Benincasa, who, like Jeanne d’Arc, looking round
upon the misery of her country, believed that she was called by
God to show her fellow countrymen the way of salvation.</p>

<p>St. Catherine, for she was afterwards canonized, was one of
the twenty-five children of a Sienese dyer, who was at first very
angry that his daughter refused to marry and instead joined the
Order of Dominican Tertiaries&mdash;that is, of women who, still
remaining in their own homes, bound themselves by vows to
obey a religious rule.</p>

<p>In time, not only the dyer but all Siena came to realize that
Catherine possessed a mind and spirit far above ordinary
standards, so that, while in her simplicity she would accept the
meanest household tasks, she had yet so great an understanding
of the larger issues of life that she could read the cause of each
man or woman’s trouble who came to her, and suggest the remedy
they needed to give them fresh courage or hope.</p>

<p>During an outbreak of plague in Siena it was Catherine who,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>
undismayed and tireless, went everywhere amongst the sick and
dying, infusing new heart into the weary doctors and energy
into patients succumbing helplessly to the disease.</p>

<p>When one of the wild young nobles of the town was condemned
to death according to the harsh law of the day for having dared
to criticize his government, Catherine visited him in prison. She
found him raging up and down his cell like some trapped wild
animal, refusing all comfort; but her presence and sympathy
brought him so great a sense of peace and even of thanksgiving
that he went to the scaffold at last joyfully, we are told, calling
it ‘the holy place of justice’. Here, not shrinking from the
scene of death itself, Catherine awaited him, kneeling before the
block, and received his head in her lap when it was severed from
his body. ‘When he was at rest,’ she wrote afterwards, showing
what the strain had been, ‘my soul also rested in peace and quiet.’</p>

<p>St. Catherine was not alarmed when ambassadors from other
cities, and even messengers from the Pope at Avignon, came to
ask her advice on thorny problems. She believed that she was a
messenger of God, ‘servant and slave of the servants of Jesus
Christ’, as she styled herself in her letters, and that God intended
the regeneration of Italy to be brought about neither by Emperor,
nor by a Holy Roman Republic, but by the Pope himself. No
longer must he live at Avignon, but return to Rome, and, once
established there, begin the work of reform so sorely needed both
by Church and State. Then would follow a call to the world
that, recognizing by his just and generous acts that he was indeed
the ‘Father of Christendom’, would joyfully come to offer its
allegiance.</p>

<p>This high ideal touched the hearts and imaginations of even
the least spiritual of Catherine’s contemporaries. One of her
letters was addressed to that firebrand Sir John Hawkwood,
whom she besought to turn his sword away from Italy against
the Turks; and it is said that on reading it he took an oath that
if other captains would go on a crusade he would do so also.</p>

<p>St. Catherine herself went to Avignon and saw Pope Gregory
XI&mdash;a timid man, who loved luxury and peace of mind, fearing
greatly the turbulence of Rome. At this time all the barons of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>
the Campagna and most of the cities on the papal estates were
up in arms, and Gregory had been warned that unless he went
in person to pacify the combatants he was likely to lose all his
temporal possessions. Catherine, when consulted, told him
sternly that he should certainly return to Italy, but not for this
reason.</p>

<p>‘Open the eyes of your intelligence,’ she said, ‘and look
steadily at this matter. You will then see, Holy Father, that ...
it is more needful for you to win back souls than to reconquer
your earthly possessions.’</p>

<p>In January 1377 St. Catherine gained her most signal triumph,
for Gregory XI, at her persuasion, appeared in Rome and took
up his quarters there, so bringing to an end the ‘Babylonish
Captivity’. Not long afterwards he died; and the Romans who
had rejoiced at his coming were overwhelmed with fear that his
successor might be a Frenchman and return to Avignon. ‘Give
us a Roman!’ they howled, surging round the palace where the
College of Cardinals, or Consistory, as it was called, was holding
the election; and the cardinals, believing that they would be
torn in pieces unless they at least chose an Italian, hastily elected
a Neapolitan, the Archbishop of Bari, who took the name of
Urban VI.</p>

<p>It was an unfortunate choice. Urban honestly wished to
reform the Church, but of Christian charity, without which good
deeds are of no avail, he possessed nothing. Arrogant, passionate,
and fierce in his frequent hatreds, blind to either tact or
moderation, he tried to force the cardinals by threats and insults
into surrendering their riches and pomp. ‘I tell you in truth,’
exclaimed one of them, when he had listened to the Pope’s first
fiery denunciations, ‘you have not treated the Cardinals to-day
with the respect they received from your predecessors. If you
diminish our honour we shall diminish yours.’</p>

<p>Rome was soon aflame with the plots of the rebellious college,
whose members finally withdrew from the city, declared that
they had been intimidated in their choice by the mob, that the
election of Urban was therefore invalid, and that they intended
to appoint some one else. As a result of this new conclave there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>
appeared a rival Pope, Clement VII, who after a short civil
war fled from Italy and took up his residence at Avignon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Great Schism</div>

<p>The period that followed is called the Great Schism, one of
the times of deepest humiliation into which the papal power
ever descended. From Rome and Avignon two sets of bulls,
claiming divine sanction and the necessity of human obedience,
went forth to Christendom, their authors each declaring himself
the one lawful successor of St. Peter, and Father of the Holy
Catholic Church.</p>

<p>With Clement VII sided France, her ally Scotland, Spain,
and Naples; with Urban VI, Germany, England, and most of
the northern kingdoms; and when these Popes died the
cardinals they had elected perpetuated the schism by choosing
fresh rivals to rend the unity of the Church. Thus in the
struggle for temporal supremacy reform was forgotten, and the
growing spirit of doubt and scepticism given a fair field in
which to sow her seed.</p>

<p>St. Catherine had realized her desire, the return of the Pope to
Rome, only, we see, to find it fail in achieving the purpose for
which she had prayed and planned. The Popes of the fourteenth
century were men of the age in which they lived, not
great souls like the saint of Siena herself, who called them to
a task of which they were spiritually incapable. With her
death her ideal faded, and another gradually took shape in the
minds of men, namely, ‘an appeal from the Vicar of Christ
on earth to Christ Himself, residing in the whole body of the
Church’.</p>

<p>Christendom remembered that in the early days of her
history it had been Councils of the Fathers, sitting at Nicea
and elsewhere, that had defined the Faith and made laws for
the Catholic Church. Now it was suggested that once more
a large world-council should be called from every Catholic
nation, composed of Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops, the
Heads of the Friars and of the Monastic and Military Orders,
together with Doctors of Theology and Law. This council was
to be given power by the whole of Christendom to end the
schism, condemn heresy, and reform the Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>
The person who was chiefly responsible for the summoning
of this council, that met at Constance in 1414, was Sigismund,
King of the Romans, a son of the Emperor Charles IV, and
brother and heir to the Emperor Wenzel, a drunken sot, who
was also King of Bohemia, but quite incapable of playing an
intelligent part in public affairs. Sigismund was King of
Hungary by election and through his marriage with a daughter
of Louis the Great<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>; but his subjects had little respect for his
ability, and were usually in a state of chronic rebellion. In spite
of the fact that he had no money and had been decisively and ingloriously
defeated in battle by the Turks, he continued to hold
high ambitions, desiring above all things to appear as the arbiter
of European destinies who would reform both Church and State.</p>

<p>The Council of Constance gave him his opportunity, and
certainly no other man worked as hard to make it a success.
Sometimes he presided in person at the meetings, which dragged
out their weary discussions for about four years: at other times
he would visit the courts of Europe, trying to persuade rival
Popes to resign, or, if they were obstinate, civil sovereigns
to refuse them patronage and protection. He even tried, though
in vain, to act as mediator in the Hundred Years’ War, in order
that the political quarrels of French and English might not
bring friction to the council board.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John Huss</div>

<p>It is unfortunate for Sigismund’s memory that his share in
the Council of Constance was marred by treachery. As heir
to the throne of Bohemia and the incapable Wenzel he was
often led to interfere in the affairs of that kingdom, and felt it
his duty to take some steps with regard to the spread of
Wycliffe’s doctrines amongst his future subjects, especially in
the national University of Prague. Here heretical views were
daily expounded by a clever priest and teacher, John Huss.
Now the orthodox Catholics in the university were mainly
Germans, and hated by the ordinary Bohemians, who were
Slavs, and these therefore admired and followed Huss for
national as well as from religious convictions.</p>

<p>Sigismund agreed with Huss in desiring a drastic reform<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span>
of the Church, suitable means for ensuring which he hoped to
see devised at Constance. At the same time he trusted that
the representatives of Christendom would come to some kind
of a compromise with the Bohemian teacher on his religious
views, and persuade him by their arguments to withdraw some
of his most unorthodox opinions. With this end in view he
therefore invited Huss to appear at the Council, offering him
a safe-conduct.</p>

<p>Many of the Bohemians suspected treachery and shook their
heads when their national hero insisted that he was bound in
honour to make profession of his faith when summoned. ‘God
be with you!’ exclaimed one, ‘for I fear greatly that you will
never return to us.’ This prophecy was fulfilled; for Huss,
when he arrived at Constance, found that Sigismund was
absent, and the attitude of the Council definitely hostile to anything
he might say. After a prolonged examination he was
called upon to recant his errors, and, refusing to yield, was
condemned to death as a heretic; Sigismund, on his return to
Constance shortly after this sentence had been passed, was
persuaded that unless he consented to withdraw his safe-conduct
the whole gathering would break up in wrath.</p>

<p>Herod, he was told, had made a bad oath in agreeing to
fulfil the wish of Herodias’s daughter and should have refused
her demand for the head of John the Baptist. To pledge faith
to a heretic was equally wrong, for as an example and warning
to Christendom all heretics should be burned. It was imperative
therefore for the good of the Church that such a safe-conduct
should be withdrawn. Sigismund at last sullenly yielded,
conscious of the stain on his honour, yet still more fearful lest
the council he had called together with so great an effort should
melt away, its tasks unfulfilled, as his many enemies hoped.</p>

<p>In July 1415 Huss was burned alive, crying aloud with steadfast
courage as those about him urged him to recant, ‘Lo! I am
prepared to die in that truth of the Gospel which I taught and
wrote.’ Lest he should be revered as a martyr, the ashes of
Huss were flung into the river, his very clothes destroyed;
but measures that had prevailed when an Arnold of Brescia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>
preached to a few, some two centuries before, were unavailing
when a John Huss died for the faith of a nation. Sigismund
kept his council together, but he paid for his broken word in
the flame of hatred that his accession in 1419 aroused in Bohemia,
and which lasted during the seventeen years of what are usually
called the Hussite Wars.</p>

<p>The Council of Constance had condemned heresy: it succeeded
in deposing three rival popes, and by its united choice
of a new pope, Martin V, it put an end to the long schism that had
divided the Church. The question of reform, the most vital
of all the problems discussed, resulted in such controversy that
men grew weary, and it was postponed for settlement to another
council that the new pope pledged himself to call in five years.</p>

<p>Such were the practical results of the first real attempt of
the Church to solve the problems of mediaeval times, not by
the decision of one man, whether pope or emperor, but by the
voice of Christendom at large. If the attempt failed the difficulties
in the way were so great that failure was inevitable.</p>

<p>The Conciliar Movement was modern in the sense that it was
an appeal to the judgement of the many rather than of a single
autocrat; but it proved too mediaeval in actual construction
and working for the growing spirit of nationality that brought
its prejudices and misunderstandings to the council hall.
English and French, Germans and Bohemians, Italians and
men from beyond the Alps, were too mutually suspicious, too
assured of the righteousness of their own outlook, to be able
to sacrifice their individual, or still more their national,
convictions to traditional authority. The day for world-rule,
as mediaeval statesmen understood the term, had passed; and
the Council of Constance was a witness to its passing.</p>

<span class="subhead">PART I. THE FALL OF THE GREEK EMPIRE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The final failure of Christendom to preserve Eastern Europe
from the infidel may be traced back to the disastrous Fourth
Crusade<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> in the thirteenth century, when Venice, for purely
selfish reasons, drove out the Greek rulers of Constantinople,
and helped to establish a Latin or Frankish Empire. This
Empire lasted for fifty-seven years, weak in its foundation, and
growing ever weaker like a badly built house, ready to tumble to
the ground at the first tempest. It pretended to embrace all the
territory that had belonged to its predecessors, but many of the
feudal landowners whom it appointed were never able to take
possession of their estates that remained under independent
Greek or Bulgarian princes, while in Asia Minor the exiled
Greek emperors ruled at Nicea, awaiting an opportunity to cross
the Bosporus and effect a triumphant return.</p>

<p>Michael Paleologus, to whom the opportunity came, was an
unscrupulous adventurer who, on account of his military reputation,
had been appointed guardian of the young Emperor of
Nicea, John Ducas, a boy of eight. Taking advantage of this
position, Michael drove from the court all whom he knew to be
disinterested partisans of his charge, and then declared himself
joint emperor with the child. This ambitious claim was but a
step to worse deeds, for before he was ten years old the unhappy
little Emperor had been blinded and thrust into a dungeon by
his co-emperor’s orders, and the Paleologi had become the
reigning house of the Eastern Empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Eastern Empire</div>

<p>This was an evil day for Christendom, for though Michael
Paleologus beat down the resistance of all the Greek princes who
dared to resent the way in which he had usurped the throne, and
afterwards succeeded in entering Constantinople, yet neither he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">328</a></span>
nor his descendants were the type of men to preserve what he
had gained. Nearly all the Paleologi were weak and false:
Michael himself so shifty in his dealings that his friends trusted
him less than his enemies. Because he had won his throne by
fraud and cruelty he was always suspicious, like Italian despots,
lest one of his generals should turn against him and outwit him.
Instead, therefore, of keeping his attention fixed on the steadily
increasing power of the Mahometans, an inspection that would
have warned a wise man to maintain a strong army along the
borders of the Empire in Asia Minor, he was so afraid of his
own Greek troops that, once established in Constantinople,
he disbanded whole regiments, and exiled their best officers.
Everything he did, in fact, was calculated merely to secure his
immediate safety or advantage, with no thought for the future, so
that he died leaving his kingdom an easy prey to foreign enemies
strong enough to seize the advantage.</p>

  <img src="images/i_336.jpg" width="600" height="480" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>The NEAR EAST
  in the MIDDLE AGES</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">329</a></span>
Besides the misrule of Michael Paleologus, other factors were
at work, busily undermining the restored Greek Empire. For
one thing, the Greek and Bulgarian princes, who had obtained
independence when the Latins ruled in Constantinople, had no
intention of returning to their old allegiance; while here and
there were feudal states, like the Duchy of Athens, established
by the Latins and still held by them, although the Frankish
Emperor who had been their suzerain had disappeared. The
islands in the Aegean Sea were most of them in Venetian hands,
and Venice took care that the Greek Empire, whose fleet she
had swept from the Mediterranean in the thirteenth century,
should not construct another sufficiently strong to win back these
commercial and naval bases. In the same way the trade that had
passed from Constantinople never returned: for the cities of the
Mediterranean preferred to deal on their own account with
Syrian and Egyptian merchants rather than to pay toll to
a ‘middleman’ in the markets of the Paleologi.</p>

<p>For all these reasons it can be easily seen that the new
Byzantine Empire was in a far worse state of weakness and
instability than the old. Like Philip IV of France, who found
the financial methods of Charlemagne quite inadequate for
dealing with his more modern needs and expenses, the Paleologi
were confronted by a system of administering laws and exacting
taxes that, having completely broken down under the strain of
foreign invasion, was even more incapable of meeting fourteenth-century
problems with any feasible solution. More practical
rulers might have invented new methods, but the only hope of
the upstart line that had usurped power without realizing the
responsibility such power entailed was to seek the military and
financial aid of the West as in the days of Alexius Commenus.</p>

<p>Little such aid was there to gain. Venice and Genoa, once
eager crusaders, were now too busy contesting the supremacy of
the Mediterranean to act together as allies in Eastern waters.
The Popes, annoyed that the overthrow of the Latin Empire had
brought about the restoration of the Greek Church, were willing
enough to consider the reconversion of Byzantium held out to
them as a bait; but even if they granted their sympathy they had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">330</a></span>
obviously too many political troubles of their own to make lavish
promises likely of fulfilment. Western Europe, in fact, was too
interested in its own national struggles to answer calls to
a crusade, too blind in its narrow self-interest and prejudice
against the Greeks to realize what danger the ruin of Constantinople
must bring on those who had for centuries used her as
a bulwark.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Turkish Invasion of Europe</div>

<p>Andronicus II, the son and successor of Michael, was equally
cruel and false, and still more of a personal coward. He saw
the danger of Mahometan invasion that his father had ignored,
and, in terror both of the Turks and of his own subjects, arranged
to hire a band of Catalan mercenaries who had been fighting for
the Aragonese against the Angevins in Sicily, in the war introduced
by the Sicilian Vespers.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> This war over, the captain of
the Catalans, Roger de Flor, a Templar who had been expelled
from his Order for his wild deeds, was quite willing to unsheathe
his sword on a new field of glory and pillage; so that on
receiving dazzling promises of reward and friendship he and his
‘merry men’ sailed for the East.</p>

<p>Once established in Greece, however, the Catalans proved so
arrogant and lawless that the Greeks complained that they were a
far worse infliction than the Mahometans. Quarrels ensued, and
finally, in the course of a bitter dispute between Roger de Flor
and Andronicus, the Spanish general was murdered as he stood
talking to his master. This act of treachery, added to growing
indignation at the limited supplies of money the Emperor had
grudgingly disbursed for his foreign army, turned the Catalans
from pretence allies into a horde of raging enemies. From the
walls of Constantinople itself they were driven back, but elsewhere
they burned and slew and laid waste the country, until at last,
reaching Athens, they stormed the walls of that city, killed
its Latin Duke, and established themselves as an independent
republic.</p>

<p>By the time they had ceased to rove the Catalans had also
ceased to be dangerous, but in their savage wanderings they had
inflicted incalculable harm upon the Byzantine Empire. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">331</a></span>
Andronicus who could barely hold them at bay before the gates
of his capital was an Andronicus who could not hope to withstand
invasion in Asia Minor; and over his Eastern boundaries,
left weakly garrisoned since the days of Michael Paleologus,
poured the Turks in irresistible numbers. Soon there remained
to the Greek Empire, of all their provinces across the Bosporus,
merely a strip of coast-line to the north of the Dardanelles, and
finally this also was whittled away, and the Turks crossed
the Straits and captured Gallipoli as a base for future operations
in Europe.</p>

<p>The chief Mahometan Emir during this period of conquest
was a certain Orkhan, the son of Othman, whose name in
the form ‘Ottoman’ is still borne by his branch of the Turkish
race. This Orkhan was quite as cruel and unscrupulous as the
Paleologi, but far more statesmanlike; for as he conquered the
territory of Greek Emperors and rival Emirs in Asia Minor he
consolidated his rule over them by a just and careful government
that gradually welded them into a compact state.</p>

<p>When a civil war broke out between John V, the grandson of
Andronicus II, and his guardian and co-ruler, a wily schemer of
the Michael Paleologus type called John Cantacuzenus, the
latter, with utter lack of patriotism, appealed to Orkhan for aid.
He even offered him his daughter in marriage, an alliance
to which the Turk eagerly agreed, dispatching a large force of
auxiliaries to Thrace as token of his friendly intentions towards
his future father-in-law. These troops he determined should
remain, and difficult indeed the Christians found it to dislodge
them in later years, for the Turkish legions had been stiffened
by a device of Orkhan which has done more to keep his name in
men’s minds perhaps than any of his victories.</p>

<p>It was the Emir’s custom on a march of conquest not to
oppress the conquered, but to exact from them a tribute both in
money and in child life. From every village that passed under
the rule of Orkhan his soldiers carried away from their homes a
fixed number of young boys, chosen because of their health and
sturdy, well-developed limbs. These children were placed
in barracks, where they were educated without any knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">332</a></span>
of their former life to become soldiers of the Prophet&mdash;fanatical,
highly disciplined, skilled with the bow and sabre, inculcated
with but one ideal and ambition&mdash;to excel in statecraft or on the
battle-field.</p>

<p>Because of their excessive loyalty emirs would choose from
among the ranks of these ‘tribute children’ their viziers and
other chief officials, while the majority would enter the infantry
corps of ‘Janissaries’, or ‘new soldiers’, whose ferocity and endurance
in attacking or holding apparently impossible positions
became the terror of Europe. In the words of a modern historian,
‘With diabolical ingenuity the Turks secured the victory of the
Crescent by the Children of the Cross, and trained up Christian
boys to destroy the independence and authority of their country
and their Church.’</p>

<p>In 1361, some years after Orkhan’s death, the Turks captured
Adrianople, and thus came into contact with other Christian
nations besides the Greeks, namely, the Serbians and Hungarians.</p>

<p>The Serbians were the principal Slav race in the Balkans, and
under their great ruler Stephen Dushan it had seemed likely
that they might become the predominant power in Eastern
Europe. The Kings of Bulgaria and Bosnia were their vassals;
they had made conquests both in Albania and Greece, thus
opening up a way to the Adriatic and Aegean Seas. It would
have been well for Christendom if this energetic race of fighters
could have subdued the feeble Greeks, and so presented to the
Turks, when they crossed the Bosporus, a foe worthy to
match the Janissaries in stubborn courage. Unfortunately
Stephen Dushan died before the years of Turkish invasion,
leaving his throne to a young son, ‘a youth of great parts,’ as a
Serbian chronicler describes him, ‘quiet and gracious, but without
experience.’</p>

<p>Only experience or an iron will could have held together in
those rough times a kingdom relying for its protection on the
swords of a quarrelsome nobility; and Serbia broke up into
a number of small principalities, her disintegration assisted by
the ambitious jealousy of Louis the Great of Hungary, who lost
no opportunity of dismembering and weakening this sister kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">333</a></span>
that might otherwise prove a hindrance to his own imperial
projects.</p>

<p>With the career of Louis we have dealt in other chapters, and
have seen him humbling the Venetians, driving Joanna I out of
Naples, acquiring the throne of Poland, fighting against the
Turks and the Emperor Charles IV. Because he spent his
energy recklessly on all these projects, Louis remains for
posterity, apart from the civilizing influence of his court life,
one of the arch-destroyers of the Middle Ages, the sovereign
who more than any other exposed Eastern Europe to Mahometan
conquest. Had he either refrained from his constant policy of
aggression towards Serbia, thus allowing her to unite her subject
princes in the face of the invading Turks, or had he even been
powerful enough to found an Empire of Hungary that would
absorb both Serbia and Constantinople and act as a bulwark in
the East, mediaeval history would have closed on a different
scene. Instead, the famous victories of Louis over the Turks,
that made his name honoured by Christendom, were rendered
of no avail by other partial victories over Christian nations who
should have been his allies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Kossovo</div>

<p>On the field of Kossovo, in 1389, the Serbians, shorn of half
their provinces and weakened and betrayed by the Hungarians,
met the Turks in battle. Both sides have left record of the
ferocity of the struggle. ‘The angels in Heaven’, said the
Turks, ‘amazed by the hideous noise, forgot the heavenly hymns
with which they always glorify God.’ ‘The battle-field became
like a tulip-bed with its ruddy severed heads and rolling turbans.’
‘Few’, wrote the Serbian chronicler, ‘returned to their own
country.’</p>

<p>When the day closed, both the Serbian king, Lazar, and the
Turkish sultan lay dead amid their warriors, and the victory, as
far as the actual fighting was concerned, seemed to rest neither
with Christian nor Moslem. Yet, in truth, the Turk could supply
other armies, as numerous and as well-equipped, to take the place
of those who had fallen, while the Serbians had exhausted their
uttermost effort: thus the fruits of the battle fell entirely into the
hands of the infidel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">334</a></span>
‘Things are hard for us, hard since Kossovo,’ is a modern
Serbian saying, for the Serbs have never forgotten the day when
they fought their last despairing battle as champions of the Cross,
and lost for a time their ambition of dominating Eastern Europe.</p>

</div>

<p>From the day of Kossovo the ultimate conquest of Eastern
Europe by the Turks became a certainty. Lack of ambition on
the part of some of the sultans and a life and death struggle in
which others found themselves involved in Asia Minor against
Tartar tribes merely deferred the time of reckoning, but it came
at last in the middle of the fifteenth century, when Mohammed
II, ‘the Conqueror’, determined to reign in Constantinople.</p>

<p>This Mohammed, famous in mediaeval history, was the son of
a Serbian princess, and he is said to have grown up indifferent
alike to Christianity or Islam. He is described as having ‘a pair
of red and white cheeks full and round, a hooked nose, and
a resolute mouth’, while flatterers went still farther and declared
that his moustache was ‘like leaves over two rosebuds, and every
hair of his beard a thread of gold’. In character, from a fierce,
undisciplined boy he grew into a self-willed man, intent upon the
satisfaction of his ambitions and desires. He could speak, or at
least understand, Arabic, Greek, Persian, Hebrew, and Latin;
and chroniclers record that it was in reading the triumphs of
Alexander and Julius Caesar that he was first inspired with the
thought of becoming a great general.</p>

<p>His rival, Constantine XI, the last and best of the Paleologi,
was a man of very different type from the Turk, or indeed from
his own ancestors. He was devoted to the Christian religion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">335</a></span>
and Greece&mdash;brave, simple, and generous. When he first
became aware of Mohammed’s aggressive hostility he attempted
to disarm it by liberating Turkish prisoners. ‘If it shall please
God to soften your heart’, he sent word, ‘I shall rejoice; but
however that may be, I shall live and die in the defence of my
people and of my Faith.’ His words were put to the test when,
in the autumn of 1452, the siege of Constantinople began.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fall of Constantinople</div>

<p>The Emperor looked despairingly for Western aid, in order to
secure which the Emperor John V had himself in years gone by
visited Rome and made formal renunciation to the Pope of all
the views of the Greek Church that disagreed with Catholic
doctrine. One of the chief points of controversy had been the
Catholic use of unleavened bread in the Sacrament of the Mass;
another, the words of the Nicene Creed, declaring that the Holy
Ghost ‘proceeded’ from the Son as well as from the Father.</p>

<p>In all matters of faith as well as of ecclesiastical jurisdiction
John V, and later Constantine himself, had made open acknowledgement
of the supremacy of Rome, but their compliance did
not avail to save their kingdom in the hour of danger: indeed,
while it evoked little military support from Catholic nations it
aroused keen hostility and treachery at home. There were many
Greeks who refused to endorse their sovereign’s signature to
what they considered an act of national betrayal, some declaring
openly that the Mahometan victories were God’s punishment on
kings who had forsaken the faith of their fathers, and that it would
be better to see the turbans of the infidels in St. Sophia than
a cardinal’s red hat.</p>

<p>When, then, Mohammed began to thunder with his fourteen
batteries against the once impregnable walls of Constantinople,
making enormous breaches, the reduction of the city had become
only a question of days. It is said that the Sultan in his eagerness
to take possession offered the Emperor and his army
freedom and religious toleration if they would capitulate. ‘I
desire either my throne or a grave,’ replied Constantine, knowing
well which of the two must be his fate.</p>

<p>Beside some four thousand of his own subjects he could command
only a few hundred mercenaries sent by the Pope, and three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">336</a></span>
hundred Genoese. Of the Venetians and other Western Europeans
there were even less; and it was with this miniature army
that he manned the wide circuit of the walls, led out sorties, and
rebuilt as well as he could the gaps made by the heavy guns.</p>

<p>The contest was absurdly unequal, for Mohammed had some
two hundred and fifty-eight thousand men; and in May 1453
the inevitable end came to a heroic struggle. Up through the
breaches in the wall, that no labour was left to repair, climbed
wave after wave of fanatical Janissaries, shouting their hopes of
victory and Paradise. Beneath their continuous onslaughts the
defenders weakened and broke, fighting to the last amid the narrow
streets, until Constantine himself was slain, his body only
recognized later by the golden eagles embroidered on his shoes.</p>

<p>The women, and many of the Greeks who had refused to help
in this time of crisis because of the Emperor’s submission to the
Catholic Church, were torn from their sanctuary in St. Sophia
and sold as slaves in the markets of Syria.</p>

<p>Thus was lost the second city of Christendom to the infidels,
and the old Roman Empire, whose restoration had been a
mediaeval idea for centuries, perished for ever.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Retribution, at least according to human ideas of justice,
often seems to lag in history; but in the case of the fall of Constantinople
some of the culprits most responsible, on account of
their selfish indifference, were speedily called on to pay the
penalty. Mohammed II, his ambition inflated by what he had
already achieved, planned the reduction of Christendom, declaring
that he would feed his horse from the altar of St. Peter’s
in Rome. With an enormous army he advanced through Serbia
and besieged Belgrade; but here he was thrust back by a
Christian champion, John Hunyadi, ‘the wicked one’, as the
title reads in Turkish, with such loss of men and material ‘that
Hungary and eastern Germany were saved from serious danger
for eighty years’.</p>

<p>With the Balkan states it was otherwise, whose governments,
divided in their counsels, jealous in their rivalries, had been
incapable of the union that could alone have saved them, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">337</a></span>
one by one they were crushed beneath ‘the Conqueror’s’ heel.
Greece also came under Moslem domination, and finally the
islands of the Aegean Sea that Venice had torn from Constantinople
in the interests of her trade were wrested away from her,
leaving her faced with the prospect of commercial ruin.</p>

<h3 id="part2">PART II. VOYAGE AND DISCOVERY</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Marco Polo</div>

<p>All through the Middle Ages it had been to the cities of the
Mediterranean, first of all to Amalfi and Pisa, then to Marseilles,
Barcelona, Genoa, and Venice, that Europe had turned as her
obvious medium of communication with the East and all its fabulous
wonders. In the thirteenth century a Venetian merchant,
Marco Polo, setting forth with his father and uncle, had visited
the kingdom of Cathay, or China, and brought back twenty years
later not only marvellous tales of the court of Khubla Khan in
Pekin, but also precious stones, rubies, sapphires, diamonds, and
emeralds in such abundance that he was soon nicknamed by his
fellow citizens ‘Marco of the Millions’.</p>

<p>Into the delighted ears of the guests he invited to a banquet
on his return he poured descriptions of a land where ‘merchants
are so numerous and so rich that their wealth can neither be told
nor believed. They and their ladies do nothing with their own
hands, but live as delicately as if they were kings.’ What
seems to have struck his mediaeval mind with most astonishment
were the enormous public baths in the ‘City of Heaven’
in southern China, of which there were four thousand, ‘the
largest and most beautiful baths in the world.’</p>

<p>The banquets also given by the great Khan excelled any
European feasts. They were attended by many thousands of
guests, and their host, raised on a dais, had as his servants the
chief nobles, who would wind rich towels round their mouths
that they might not breathe upon the royal plates. For presents
the Khan was accustomed to receive at a time some five thousand
camels, or an equal number of elephants, draped in silken cloths
worked with silver and gold. His government surpassed in its
organization anything Europe had imagined since the fall of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">338</a></span>
Roman Empire, such, for instance, as the postal system, by
means of messengers on foot and horse, that linked up Pekin
with lands a hundred days distant, or the beneficent regard of
a ruler who in times of bad harvests not only remitted taxation
but dispatched grain to the principal districts that had suffered.</p>

<p>Coal was used in China freely, ‘a kind of black stone cut from
the mountains in veins,’ as Marco Polo describes it. ‘It maintains
the fire’, he added, ‘better than wood, and throughout the
whole of Cathay this fuel is used.’</p>

<p>Besides dilating on the wealth and prosperity of China, the
Venetian had also much to say of Zipangu, or Japan, of Tibet
and Bengal, of Ceylon, ‘the finest island in the world,’ and of
Java, supposed then to be ‘above three thousand miles wide’.</p>

<p>Other travellers were to confirm many of his statements, but
none told their tale so simply and realistically as Polo, while not
a few, like the English Sir John Mandeville in the fourteenth
century, supplied fiction in large doses where it seemed to them
that truth might bore their readers. The eagerness with which
either fact or fiction was swallowed bears witness, at any rate, first
to the extraordinary fascination excited in mediaeval minds by
such names as ‘Cathay’ or ‘Zipangu’; and next to the general
Western belief in the inexhaustible riches of the East and their
determination to secure at least a portion.</p>

<p>When the Seljuk Turks, with their fierce animosity towards
Christendom, had settled like a curtain between East and West,
the dangers and expense of trading and commerce with Arabia
and Asia Minor of course increased. Venice and Genoa still
brought back shiploads of silks, spices, and perfumes for Western
markets, but the price of these goods was increased by the tolls
paid to Turkish sultans and emirs for leave to transfer merchandise
from camels to trading-sloops. Then came the fall of Constantinople,
when Venice, by a treaty with ‘the Conqueror’ in
the following year, appeared to secure wonderful trading
privileges. Mohammed, however, made such promises only to
break them when convenient, and, so soon as he could afford to do
so, because he was securely established in Europe, the tolls he
demanded became heavier, not lighter, the restrictions he placed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">339</a></span>
upon trade more and more galling to Christian merchants, until
the usual purchasers of Venetian goods grew exasperated at
prices that doubled and trebled continually.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage and Discovery</div>

<p>There were but two methods of avoiding this ever-increasing
policy of exploitation apart from doing without such luxuries:
either a complete conquest of the Turks, that would compel
them to open up afresh the old caravan routes to the East; or
else the discovery of a new route that would avoid their dominions
altogether. Largely through the blind selfishness of Mediterranean
cities, and especially of Venice, we have seen that the
golden opportunity of aiding the Byzantine Empire had been
lost for ever. Thus the first method failed. It remains to deal
with the second, the voyages of discovery with which the Middle
Ages fittingly close.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry ‘the Navigator’</div>

<p>Towards the end of the fourteenth century there was born in
Portugal a prince, Henry, third son of King John I, and grandson
by an English mother of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster.
While he was still a boy this prince earned fame for his share in
the capture of Ceuta, a Moorish town exactly opposite Gibraltar
on the North African coast. To the ordinary Portuguese mind
this conquest raised hopes of a gradual absorption of the southern
Mediterranean seaboard, possibly of competition in the Levant
with Genoa and Venice; but Prince Henry saw farther than
ordinary minds. The problem that he set himself and any one,
Arab or European, who seemed likely to supply a solution was&mdash;What
would happen if, instead of entering the Mediterranean,
Portuguese ships were to sail due south? How big was this
unknown stretch of land called Africa, in the maps of which
geographers hid their ignorance by placing labels, such as ‘Here
are hippografs! Here are two-headed monsters!’? Would it
not be possible to reach the far-famed wonders of Cathay by
sailing first south and then east round Africa, thus avoiding trade
routes through Syria and southern Russia?</p>

<p>It was fortunate that Prince Henry was a mathematician and
geographer himself, for many people told him in answer to his
inquiries that Africa ended at Cape Nam, not so many miles
south of Tangier, and others that the white man who dared to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span>
sail beyond a certain point would be turned black by the heat of
the sun, while the waters boiled about his vessel and the winds
blew sheets of flame across the horizon.</p>

<p>Prince Henry refused to believe such tales. He could not
sail himself, because he was so often occupied with wars in Africa
against the Moors; but year after year he fitted out ships at his
own expense, and chose the most daring mariners whom he could
find, bribing them with promises of reward and fame to navigate
the unknown African coast. He himself built a naval arsenal at
Sagres on a southern promontory of Portugal, and here, when
not busy with affairs of state, he would study the heavens, make
charts, and watch anxiously for the returning sails of his brave
adventurers.</p>

<p>During Prince Henry’s lifetime Portuguese or Italians in his
pay discovered not only Madeira, or ‘the island of wood’, as
they christened it from its many forests, but the Canaries, Cape
Verde Islands, and the African coast as far south as Gambia and
Sierra Leone. Soon there was no longer any need to bribe
mariners into taking risks, for those who first led the way on
these adventurous voyages brought back with them negroes and
gold dust as evidence that they had been to lands where men
could live, and where there were possibilities of untold wealth.
Thus the work of exploration continued joyfully.</p>

<p>It was in 1471, some years after the death of Prince Henry,
that Portuguese navigators crossed the Equator without being
broiled black by the sun or raising sheets of flame, as the superstitious
had predicted. The next important step on this new
road to Asia was the voyage of Bartholomew Diaz, who, sailing
ever southwards, swept in an icy wind without knowing it round
the Cape, past Table Mountain, and then, turning eastwards,
landed at last on the little island of Santa Cruz in Algoa Bay,
where he planted a cross. He would have explored the mainland
also, but Kaffirs armed with heavy stones collected and
drove back the landing-party.</p>

<p>Diaz, emboldened by his success, wished to sail farther, but
his crew were weary of adventure, and with tears of regret in his
eyes he was forced to yield to their threats of mutiny and turn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">341</a></span>
homewards. At Lisbon, describing his voyage, he said that on
account of its dangers he had called the southernmost point of
Africa the ‘Cape of Storms’, but the King of Portugal, hearing
that this was indeed the limit of the continent, and that in all
probability the way to Asia lay beyond, would not consent to
such an ill-omened name. ‘It shall be the Cape of Good Hope,’
he declared, and so it has remained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vasco da Gama</div>

<p>In 1498 the work of exploration begun by Diaz was completed
by another famous navigator, Vasco da Gama. National hopes
of wealth and glory were centred in his task, and when he and
his company marched forth to their ships a large crowd went with
them to the shore, carrying candles, and singing a solemn litany.
Then the sails of his four vessels dipped below the horizon and
were not seen for two years and eight months, but when at last
men and women had begun to despair at the great silence, their
hero reappeared amongst them, bringing news more wonderful
and glorious than anything that Portugal had dared to hope.</p>

<p>There is little space to tell in this chapter the adventures that
Vasco da Gama related to the King and his court. He and his
crews, it seemed, had sailed for weeks amid ‘a lonely dreary
waste of seas and boundless sky’: they had skirmished with
Hottentots and ‘doubled the Cape’, caught in such a whirl of
breakers and stormy winds that the walls of the wooden ships
had oozed water, and despair and sickness had seized upon all.
Vasco da Gama, even when ill and depressed, was not to be turned
from his purpose. Eastwards and northwards he set his sails,
in the teeth of laments and threats from his sailors, and so on
Christmas Day landed on a part of the coast to which in memory
of the most famous <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Dies Natalis</i> he gave the name of Natal.</p>

<p>From Natal, battling the dread disease of scurvy brought on
by a prolonged diet of salt meat, the Portuguese commander
pursued his way, attacked, as often as he landed for water and
fresh food, by fierce Mahometan tribes, until at last, guided
by an Arabian pilot whom he had picked up, he came to the
harbours of Calicut in India, where was a Christian king. The
new route to Asia had been discovered. ‘A lucky venture&mdash;plenty
of emeralds.... You owe great thanks to God for having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">342</a></span>
brought you to a country holding such riches,’ declared the
natives, and loud was the rejoicing of the Portuguese at this
glorious national prospect.</p>

<p>The likely effects of Vasco da Gama’s voyage did not pass unnoticed
elsewhere in Europe. ‘Soon,’ exclaimed a Venetian
merchant in deep gloom, ‘it will be cheaper to buy goods in
Lisbon than in Venice.’ The death-knell of the great Republic’s
commercial prosperity sounded in these words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christopher Columbus</div>

<p>In the meanwhile, some years before Vasco da Gama’s
triumphant achievement, a still greater discovery was made that
was destined in the course of time to change the whole commercial
aspect of the world. Its author was a Genoese sailor,
Christopher Columbus, who, tradition says, once sailed as far
north as Iceland, and in the south to the island of Porto Santo.
Always in his spare time he could be found bent over maps and
charts, calculating, weaving around his reasoned mathematical
arguments the tales of shipwrecked mariners, until at last he
brought to the ears of his astonished fellow men and women a
scheme for finding Cathay, neither by sailing south nor east, but
due west across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Here is a fourteenth-century description of the Atlantic,
a dismal picture still popularly accepted in the fifteenth: ‘A
vast and boundless ocean on which ships dared not venture out of
sight of land. For even if sailors knew the directions of the
winds they would not know whither those winds would carry
them; and, as there is no inhabited country beyond, they would
run great risks of being lost in the mist and vapour. The limit
of the west is the Atlantic Ocean.’</p>

<p>Many people still believed that the world was flat, and that to
sail across the Atlantic was to incur the risk of being driven by
the winds over the edge into space. Thus Columbus met with
either reproof for contemplating such risks, or ridicule for his
folly, but so convinced was he of his own wisdom that he only
grew the more enthusiastic as a result of opposition.</p>

<p>Without money or royal patronage he could not hope to make
the voyage a success, and so he laid his scheme before the King
of Portugal, usually a willing patron of adventure. Unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">343</a></span>
for Columbus, the discoveries along the African coast
promised such wealth and trade to Portugal that her ruler did
not feel inclined to take risks in other directions that, while they
must involve expense, as yet held no guarantee of repayment.</p>

<p>‘I went to take refuge in Portugal,’ wrote Columbus at a later
date, ‘since the King of that country was more versed in discovery
than any other, but ... in fourteen years I could not make
him understand what I said.’ Driven at last from Portugal by
a decided refusal, Christopher went to Spain, sending his
brother Bartholomew with a letter explaining his project to
King Henry VII of England. It is interesting to note that the
keen-witted Tudor, as soon as the scheme was laid before him, is
said to have expressed his readiness to learn more and to lend
his support; but Bartholomew had been shipwrecked on his
voyage northwards, and owing to this delay Columbus had
already received the patronage of Spain and set out on his
voyage before his brother returned with the news.</p>

<p>It was Queen Isabel of Castile, wife of King Ferdinand of
Aragon,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> who after considerable hesitation, and against the
advice of a council of leading bishops and statesmen, determined
finally to pledge her sympathy, and tradition says her jewels if
necessary, in the mariner’s cause. Part of the attraction of his project
lay in its appeal to her Castilian imagination, for Castile had
been ever haunted by the possibilities of the bleak grey ocean that
rolled at the gates of Galicia; but still more potent than the thought
of discovery was the desire of spreading the Catholic Faith.
This hope also inspired Columbus, who regarded his enterprise
as in the nature of a crusade, believing that he had been called to
preach the Gospel to the millions of heathen inhabiting Cathay.</p>

<p>When Columbus set forth on his first voyage to ‘the Indies’,
as he roughly called the unknown territory he sought, those who
sailed in his three ships were many of them ‘pressed’ men, that
is, sailors ordered on board by their town, that having incurred
royal displeasure was given this way of appeasing it. Thus they
were without enthusiasm or any belief in what they thought their
admiral’s mad and dangerous adventure, and from the time that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">344</a></span>
they lost sight of land they never ceased to grumble and utter
threats of mutiny. At one time it was the extraordinary
variations in the compass that brought them trembling to complain;
at another the steadiness of the wind blowing from the
East that they believed would never change and allow them to
return home; finally it was the sluggish waters of the Sargassa
Sea, amid whose weeds they saw themselves destined to drift
until they died of starvation and thirst. To every suggestion of
setting the sails eastward Columbus turned a deaf ear: but for
the rest he threatened, cajoled, or argued, as the occasion seemed
to demand, his own heart sinking each time the cry of ‘Land!’
was raised and the ardently desired vision proved only to be
some bank of clouds lying low upon the horizon.</p>

<p>At length came the news that a moving light had been seen in
the darkness. ‘It appeared like a candle that went up and
down,’ says Columbus in his diary, and all waited eagerly for
dawn that revealed at last a wooded island, later called the
Bahamas, but then believed to be part of the mainland of Asia.
Clad in armour, and carrying the royal banner of Spain, the
great discoverer of the West stepped ashore, and there,
humbly kneeling, he and his crews raised to Heaven a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Te Deum</i>
of thankfulness and joy.</p>

<p>Columbus made five voyages to the West in all, for the way
once shown proved easy enough, nor did he need to ‘press’
crews for the enterprise, but rather to guard against unwelcome
stowaways. The brown-skinned Indians, gaily coloured parrots,
gold nuggets, and strange roots that he brought back as witness
of his first success were enough to inflame the minds and
ambitions of Spaniards with such high hopes of wealth and glory
that they almost fought to be allowed to join the expeditions.</p>

<p>Vasco da Gama was rewarded for his voyage to India with
a large pension and the Portuguese title of ‘Dom’: he died
in honoured old age. It is sad to find that after the first
triumphant return, when no glory and praise seemed too great
to bestow on their hero, the Spaniards turned against Columbus.
They blamed him because gold was not more abundant; because
his settlers quarrelled and started feuds with the natives; because,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">345</a></span>
although a very great mariner, he did not prove a ‘governor’ able
to control and manage other men easily. Not a few were jealous
of his genius, and determined to bring about his ruin out of spite.</p>

<p>From his third voyage to the West Columbus was sent back
by his enemies in chains, ill with wounded pride at his shameful
treatment. Queen Isabel, hearing of it, instantly ordered his
release, and tried to soothe his indignation; but not long
afterwards she herself died, and Ferdinand, left to himself,
was wholly intent on Aragonese ambitions in the Mediterranean.
To him the conquest of Naples was far more important
than any discovery of Cathay, and so Columbus’s complaints
went unheeded and he died in poverty forgotten by all save a
few. ‘After twenty years of toil and peril,’ he exclaimed bitterly,
as he was borne ashore from his last voyage, ‘I do not own even
a roof in Spain.’</p>

<p>The New World to which he had won an entrance was given
the name of another, namely, of a Florentine, Amerigo Vespucci,
who, sailing beyond the West Indies, reached the mainland.</p>

<p>The effect of Columbus’s discovery upon the life of Europe was
momentous. No longer the Atlantic lay like a grey wall between
man and the Unknown. It had become a highway, not to Cathay
but to a greater West, where were riches beyond all human dreaming,
ready as a harvest for the enterprising and hardworking.</p>

<p>The central road of mediaeval commerce had been the
Mediterranean, the highway of the modern world was to be the
Atlantic, and the commercial future of Europe lay not with the
city republics of the South but with the nations of the North
and West, with Portugal and Spain, with Flanders and England,
that had lain upon the fringe of the Old World but stood at the
very heart of the New.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE RENAISSANCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>All history is the record of change, either in the direction
of social progress or decay; but so gradual is this movement
that, like the transition from night to dawn or noon to
evening, it is beyond our vision to state the moment when
tendencies began or ceased. It is only possible to note the
definite changes in their achievement, and then to disentangle
the threads by turning back along the twisted chain into which
they have been woven.</p>

<p>Sometimes in history there have been so many changes within
a short time that the effect has been cumulative and an epoch
has been created, as at the break-up of the Roman Empire, when
civilization was merged in the ‘Dark Ages’. Again, it is true
of Europe at the end of the fifteenth century and during the
greater part of the sixteenth, a period usually called ‘the Renaissance’,
or time of ‘New Birth’, because then it became apparent
that the old mediaeval outlook and ways of life had vanished,
while others much more familiar and easy to understand had
taken their place: the Modern World had been called into being.</p>

<p>The most obvious change to be found at the Renaissance was
the collapse of the mediaeval ideal of a world-empire ruled in the
name of God by Pope and Emperor. The Western Empire
still remained pretentious in its claims; but its wiser rulers, such
as Rudolph I and Charles IV, had already realized that success
lay rather in German kingship than in imperial influence. The
Popes had been restored to Rome, but the threat of councils
that could depose and reform hung like a cloud over their
insistence on the absolute obedience of Christendom; and,
recognizing the inevitable, the Vatican had sunk the ambitions
of an Innocent III in those of a temporal Italian Prince. Searching
along the chain of causes, it becomes clear enough that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">347</a></span>
trend of history during the later Middle Ages had been this
development of the smaller unity of the nation out of the bigger
unity of the world-state. By the end of the fifteenth century
England, France, and Spain were already nations; while even
Germany and Italy, feeling the call in a lesser degree, had
substituted for a wider sense of nationality devotion to a province
or city state.</p>

<p>The second of the great changes that characterize the Renaissance
was the development of the idea of man as an individual.
All through the Middle Ages, except perhaps in the case of rulers,
men and women counted in the life of the world around them,
not so much as separate influences as a part of the system into
which they were born or absorbed. In early days the tribe accepted
its members’ acts, whether good or bad, as something that
was the concern of all to be atoned for, supported, or avenged,
as a public duty. Still more strongly was this attitude expressed
in family affairs, as in the numerous ‘vendettas’, or feuds like
those of the Welfs and Waiblingen, or of ‘the Blacks’ and
‘Whites’ in Florence.</p>

<p>Turning from racial ties to social, we find mediaeval associations
of all kinds holding a man bound, not by his own personal
choice or discretion, but by the decision of the group to which
he happened to be attached. The feudal system was never complete
enough in practice to make a good example of this bondage,
but in theory from the tenant-in-chief to the landowner lowest in
the social scale there was a settled rule of life, dictating the
duties and responsibilities of lord and vassal. Still more was
this binding rule true of that greatest of all mediaeval corporations&mdash;monasticism,
that demanded from its sons and daughters
absolute obedience in the annihilation of self. St. Bernard,
whose personality was so strong that he could not remain hidden
amongst the mass of his fellows, was yet, we remember, angry with
Abelard for this above all other failings&mdash;that he had set up his
individual judgement as a test of life. In Abelard, as in Arnold
of Brescia, lay the first stirrings of the independent modern
spirit that at the Renaissance was to shake the foundations of
the mediaeval world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">348</a></span>
Besides monasticism there were other associations&mdash;the universities
and the class corporations, merchant guilds such as
the North German Hansa, and smaller city guilds, such as the
‘Greater’ and ‘Lesser Arts’ in Florence, comprising groups of
lawyers, fishmongers, &amp;c. All these last maintained a standard
of uniformity, regulating not only hours of work, rate of pay,
nature of employment, scale of contributions, like a modern
trade union, but went much farther, interfering in the life of each
individual member to insist on what he should wear in public and
how he might spend the money he had earned. It was a spirit
of benevolent slavery that held sway so long as the strivings of
the individual mind were overborne by a sense of helplessness
in the face of ignorance or by the weight of tradition.</p>

<p>This weight of tradition leads naturally to the third great
change heralded by the Renaissance&mdash;the breaking-up of a sky
curtained in mental darkness into separate groups of clouds,
still heavily charged with superstition and ignorance, but their
density relieved by the light of a genuine inquiry after truth for
its own sake. During the Middle Ages we have seen that men
and women looked back for inspiration to the Roman Empire,
and this made them distrust progress, just as a timid rider will
dread a spirited horse because he fears to lose control and to be
carried into unknown ways.</p>

<p>The earliest guardian of mediaeval knowledge had been the
Church, and in the light that she understood her task she
faithfully taught the world about her. Her motto was ‘Reverence
for the Past’; but, bent in worship before the altar
of tradition, she lost sight of that other great world-motto,
‘Trust the Future’, which has been one of the guiding stars
of modern times. Her interpretation of the Faith, of the
legitimate bounds of knowledge, of the limits of Art, had been
almost a necessary school of discipline for the early Middle Ages
with their tendency to barbaric licence; but as she civilized
men’s minds and their aptitude for reasoning and understanding
deepened, the restrictions of the school became the bars of a
prison. The mediaeval Church, once a pioneer, lost her grip
on realities, her spiritual outlook became obscured by material<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">349</a></span>
ambitions, her faith weakened; until at last so little sure was
she in her heart of the complete truth of her teaching that
she opposed and denounced criticism or discovery, much like
a merchant who is secretly afraid that his methods of business
may be obsolete refuses to entertain ‘newfangled notions’ that
would open his eyes.</p>

<p>When Columbus laid his scheme for crossing the Atlantic
before a council of bishops and leading members of the Spanish
universities, mediaeval knowledge derided his presumption by
quoting texts from the Old Testament and various statements of
St. Augustine and other Fathers of the Church. There could
be no Antipodes, they argued, because it was distinctly said that
the world was peopled by the descendants of Noah, and how
could such men have crossed these miles of ocean? Many
similar objections were raised and the mariner’s project condemned,
just as Roger Bacon had been judged a heretic for his
scientific inquiries two hundred years before.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> It is significant
of the change of mental outlook that while Roger Bacon wasted
his last years in prison and Abelard was driven from the
lecture-hall to a monastery, Columbus found public support,
vindicated his calculations, and so opened up a new world.</p>

<p>The great secret of the Renaissance is indeed this release of
the restless spirit of inquiry after truth, that is as old as humanity
itself, and that, swooping like a bird through the door of
a cage out into the air and sunshine, reckless of danger, carried
along by the sheer joy of unfettered life, sometimes foolish and
extravagant in its zest for experience, was at first too absorbed
in the glory and interest of freedom to feel any regret for the
prison that had been at least a shelter from the many stormy
problems that were to rend the modern world.</p>

<p>Charlemagne had believed that ‘without knowledge good
works were impossible’. The men of the early Renaissance
were not so intent upon the importance of good works or the
hope of salvation as their forefathers, but they would have
assented eagerly to the statement that ‘without knowledge any
true understanding of human life was impossible’.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">350</a></span>
Had the conditions under which knowledge could be obtained
remained as restricted as in mediaeval times, the Renaissance on
its intellectual side would in all probability have become a cult,
a movement shared by a few learned men and women to which
the mass of the people in every nation had no clue; and in this
way it would have died out like a plant unable to spread its roots.
Human invention intervened with the discovery of printing,
which brought the great thoughts of the world out of the
monastic libraries, where they had been laboriously collected
and copied by hand, to distribute them, slowly at first but ever
faster and faster, throughout the busy centres of Europe, where
brains as well as stomachs are always eager for food.</p>

<p>It was a German, John Gutenburg, who invented printing by
means of movable types, but because he had not enough money
to carry out his design he was forced to borrow from a rich
citizen of Mainz called John Fust. This Fust treated John
Gutenburg very badly, for he demanded back the money he had
lent so soon as he understood the value of the other’s secret, and
by this means forced Gutenburg, when he could not pay, to hand
over his plant in compensation. Fust then began to print on his
own account, and when the people of Mainz saw the copies of the
Bible that he produced, each number an exact replica of the first,
they declared that he had sold himself to the devil and was
practising magic. Thus, it is said, started the legend of Doctor
Faustus that has inspired poets, musicians, and dramatists.</p>

<p>The first English printer was William Caxton, a Kentishman,
to view whose press came King and court in great amazement,
interested, but utterly unaware of what a mental revolution this
small piece of machinery was to bring about.</p>

<p>The greatest of Italian printers were the Venetians, whose
famous Aldine press produced volumes that are still the admiration
of the world as well as treasure trove for book-collectors.
In modern times the desire for knowledge, or rather for information,
has become a scramble, and printing has degenerated into
a trade. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it was regarded
as an art, and Aldus Manutius, the Roman who established his
press at Venice, intending to reproduce an edition of all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">351</a></span>
Greek authors then known, was a great scholar, who modelled
his letters on the handwriting of the Italian poet Petrarch, and
gathered around him the most intellectual and enterprising
minds of his day to advise and help him. It was at the Aldine
press that one of the leaders of the Dutch Renaissance,
Erasmus, had several of his books printed, and Venice at
this time became a centre for scholars, and for all whose minds
were alive with a thirst for new impressions.</p>

<p>Fifteenth-century Italy was not, on the surface, so very different
from Italy in the fourteenth. The complete domination of the
five Powers, foreshadowed in the earlier century, had become
fixed, and three of them&mdash;Milan, Florence, and Naples&mdash;had
succeeded in forming an alliance to preserve the balance
of power in the peninsula, and to keep at bay the ambitions
of Venice, whose empire was still spreading over the mainland.
In Naples ruled Ferrante I, an illegitimate son of Alfonso V of
Aragon, a typical despot like the Angevins his father had replaced.
In Milan the Visconti had merged themselves in the House of
Sforza, through a clever ruse of one of the most famous of
mediaeval <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">condottieri</i>, Francesco Sforza, who, besieging his
master, Filippo Maria Visconti, in Milan in 1441, had forced
him to give him his only daughter and heiress Bianca in
marriage, and then to acknowledge him as his successor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Il Moro’</div>

<p>The grim traditions established by the Visconti continued
under this new family, christened with their very names.
Francesco’s son, Galeazzo Maria, whose life was spent in
debauch, is said to have poisoned his mother and buried his
subjects alive. When he was assassinated, his brother, Ludovico,
called from his swarthy complexion <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Il Moro</i>, or ‘the Moor’,
seized the reins of government, and proceeded to act on behalf
of his young nephew, Gian Galeazzo, whom he kept in the background
at Pavia, declaring him a helpless invalid.</p>

<p>Philip de Commines describes Ludovico as ‘clever, but very
nervous and cringing when he was afraid: a man without faith
when he thought it to his advantage to break his word’. Outwardly
he displayed the genial manners customary in a Renaissance
prince, and presided at Milan over a court so famed for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">352</a></span>
its hospitality, wit, and intellect that it drew within its circle
painters, sculptors, writers, and scholars, as well as military
heroes and men of fashion.</p>

<p>It will be seen that Italy opened her arms wide to the new
spirit of intellectual and artistic enjoyment. Venice, Naples,
Milan, each vied with the other in attracting and rewarding
genius: even the Popes at Rome, whose natural instinct as the
guardian of mediaeval tradition was to distrust freedom of
thought, were influenced by the atmosphere around them, and to
Pope Nicholas V the world owes the foundation of the wonderful
Vatican Library.</p>

<p>To the Queen of the Renaissance states we turn last&mdash;to
Florence, the ‘City of Flowers’, that we left distracted by the
internal discords of her ‘Blacks’ and ‘Whites’, and by her
wars against Filippo Maria Visconti. The turning of the
century had seen great changes in Florence, the whittling away
of the old ideal of liberty that would brook no master, so that
she became willing to accept the domination of a family superficially
disguised as a freely elected government.</p>

<p>The Medici were no royal stock, nor were they flaunting
<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">condottieri</i> like the Sforza, but a house of bankers, who by brains
and solid hard work had built up for itself a position of
respect, not only in Florence, but also throughout Europe,
where their loans had secured the fortunes of many a monarchy
that would otherwise have tumbled in ruins owing to lack of
funds. It was the advantage of such monarchies to preserve
the credit of the House of Medici, and so the bankers gained
outside influence to aid their ambitions at home.</p>

<p>Within Florence the Medici posed as common-sense men of
business, unassuming citizens, easy of access, ready friends,
ever the supporters, while they were climbing the ladder of civic
fame, of the popular party that loved to shout ‘Liberty!’ in the
streets, while it voted her destroyers into public offices.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cosimo de Medici</div>

<p>Cosimo de Medici, the first of the family to establish a position
of supremacy, was related to many of the nobles debarred by
their rank from any share in the government: but, though he
won the allegiance of this faction, he took care to claim no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">353</a></span>
honour himself that might frighten the public mind with terrors
of a despot. Instead, simply clad and almost unattended, he
walked through the streets, chatting in friendly equality with
the merchants he met, many of whose interests were identical or
wrapped up with his own financial projects; discussing agriculture
with the Tuscan farmers like a country gentleman, freely
spending his money on the schemes of the working classes, or
scattering it amongst beggars.</p>

<p>When he died his mourning fellow citizens inscribed on his
tomb the words <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pater Patriae</i>, ‘Father of his Country’. They
had felt the benefits received through Cosimo’s government:
they had not realized, or were indifferent to, the chains with
which he had bound them. Some bitter enemies he had, of
course, aroused, but these with quiet but remorseless energy he
had swept from his path. It was his custom to sap the fortunes
of possible rivals by immense exactions&mdash;to make them pay in
fact for the liberal government, for which he would afterwards
receive the praise, while drawing away their friends and
supporters by bribery and threats. At last, ruined and deserted,
they would be driven from the city; and here even Cosimo did
not rest, since his influence at foreign courts enabled him to
hunt his prey from one refuge to another until they died,
impotently cursing the name of Medici, a warning to malcontents
of the length and breadth of a private citizen’s revenge.</p>

<p>The Medici, it has been said, ‘used taxes as other men use
their swords’, and the charge of deliberate corruption that has
been brought against them is undeniable. ‘It is better to injure
the city than to ruin it,’ once declared Cosimo himself, adding
cynically, ‘It takes more to direct a government than to sit and
tell one’s beads.’</p>

<p>Neither he nor his descendants were the type of ruler
represented by Charlemagne or Alfred the Great. Their ideals
were frankly low, with self-interest in the foreground, however
skilfully disguised. When this has been admitted, however,
it should be also remembered that Cosimo employed no army of
hired ruffians to terrorize fellow citizens as the Visconti had
done. Florence was willing to be corrupted, and if she lost the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">354</a></span>
freedom she had loved in theory, yet she rose under the
benevolent despotism of the Medici to a greater height of
material and political prosperity than ever before or since in her
history. ‘The authority that they possessed in Florence and
throughout Christendom’, says Machiavelli, ‘was not obtained
without being merited.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The New Learning</div>

<p>It was under the fostering care of the Medici that Florence,
more than any of the other Italian states, became the home of
the intellectual Renaissance, from which the ‘New Learning’
was to radiate out across the world. This intellectual movement
was twofold. Still under mediaeval influence, it began at first
by finding its inspiration in the past, and so introduced a great
classical revival, in which manuscripts of Greek and Latin
authors and statues of gods and nymphs were almost as much
revered as relics of the saints in an earlier age. Rich men
hastened on journeys to the East in order to purchase half-burned
fragments of literature from astonished Greeks, while in
the lecture-halls of Italy eager pupils clamoured for fresh light
on ancient philosophy and history. So great was the enthusiasm
that it is said one famous scholar’s hair turned white with grief
when he learned of the shipwreck of a cargo of classical books.</p>

<p>Cosimo de Medici had been a ‘friend and patron of learned
men’; but it was in the time of his grandson, Lorenzo ‘the
Magnificent’, that the Renaissance reached its height in
Florence. It was Lorenzo who founded the ‘Platonic Academy’
in imitation of the old academies of Greek philosophers, an
assembly that became the battle-ground of the sharpest and most
brilliant intellects of the day. Here were fought word-tournaments,
often venomous in the intensity of their partisanship,
between defenders of the views of Plato and of Aristotle: here
were welcomed like princes cultured Greeks, driven into exile
by Mahometan invasion, certain of crowded and enthusiastic
audiences if only they were prepared to lecture on the
literary treasures of their race. The enthusiasm recalled the
days when Abelard held Paris spellbound by his reasoning on
theology, but showed how far away had slipped the age of
dialectics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">355</a></span>
The last great name amongst the schoolmen is that of Duns
Scotus, a Franciscan of the thirteenth century, who raised the
process of logical reasoning to such a fine art that it has been
said of him, ‘he reasoned scholasticism out of human reach’.
Ordinary theologians could not dispute with him, since it made
their brains reel even to try and follow his arguments, so at last
they snapped their fingers at him, crying, ‘Oh, Duns! Duns!’
Thus by his excessive skill in intellectual juggling he reduced
himself and his subject to absurdity, and ‘Dunce’ has passed down
to posterity as a fitting name for some one unreasonably stupid.</p>

<p>Scholasticism, the glory of mediaeval lecture-halls, held no
thrill or charm for men of the Renaissance, and though Aristotle
was still revered and a great deal of labour expended on trying
to make his views and those of Plato match with current
religious beliefs, yet the spirit that underlay this attempt was
wholly different to the efforts of mediaeval minds.</p>

<p>‘Salvation’, ‘The City of God’&mdash;such words and phrases
had been keys to the thought of the Middle Ages from St.
Augustine to St. Dominic and St. Thomas Aquinas. To
Renaissance minds there was but one master-word, ‘Humanity’.</p>

<p>What message had these classical philosophers, that tradition
held had lived in a golden age, for struggling humanity more than
a thousand years later? The men and women of the Renaissance,
as they put this question, hoped that the answers they discovered
would agree with the Faith that the Church had taught them;
but there was no longer the same insistence that they must or be
disregarded as heresy. The interest in an immortal soul had
become mingled with interest in what was human and transitory,
with the beauty and charm of this life as well as with the glory
of the next.</p>

<p>Searching after beauty, no longer under the stern school-mistress
‘tradition’, but led by that will-o’-the-wisp ‘literary
instinct’, the poets and authors under the influence of the
Renaissance gradually turned from the use of Latin and Greek
to that more natural medium of expression, their own language.</p>

<p>This was the second aspect of the ‘New Learning’, the
disappearance of the belief that Latin and Greek alone were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">356</a></span>
literary, and the gradual linking up of mediaeval with modern
scholarship by the discovery that the growth of national ideals
and aspirations could best be expressed in a living national
tongue. The forerunners of this movement lived long before the
period that we usually call the Renaissance. Thus Dante,
greatest of mediaeval minds, was inspired to employ his native
Italian in his masterpiece, the <cite>Divina Commedia</cite>, that, had his
genius been less original, might have been merely a classical
imitation. Petrarch, the friend of Rienzi and lover of liberty,
who lived at the papal court at Avignon, was half-ashamed of his
Italian sonnets, yet it is by their charm still more than by
his Latin letters that he lives to-day, as Boccaccio by the witty
easy-flowing style of his tales.</p>

<p>These are the names of literary ‘immortals’, and perhaps it
may seem strange to find, when we pass from them to the ‘New
Learning’ itself, that the greater part of the works published by
members of the ‘Platonic Academy’ and other intellectual circles
are now as dead as the dialectics of the schoolmen. Yet it is
still harder, if we turn their pages, to believe that such florid
sentences and long-drawn arguments could ever have stirred
men’s blood to a frenzy of enthusiasm or passion. The
explanation lies in the fact that for all the charm of its newly-won
freedom, the Renaissance, on its literary side, was not a time of
creation but of criticism and inquiry. Its leaders were too busy
clearing away outworn traditions, collecting material for fresh
thought, and laying literary foundations, to build themselves
with any breadth of vision. Where they paused exhausted, or
failed, the ‘giants’ of the modern world were able to erect their
masterpieces.</p>

<p>Lorenzo ‘the Magnificent’ himself we can remember for the
genuine love of nature and poetry apparent in his sonnets, but
his claim to remain immortal in the world’s history must rest,
not on his literary achievements, but on his generous patronage
and appreciation of scholars and artists, as well as on the political
wisdom that made him the first statesman of his day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Giotto</div>

<p>If the literature of the Renaissance was mainly experimental
in character, painting was pre-eminently its finished glory&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">357</a></span>
representation of that sense of beauty in nature and in human
life from which the Middle Ages had turned away, as from
a snare set by the Devil to distract souls from Paradise. Here
again, in painting, there is a twofold aspect: the artist mind
seeking in the past as well as aspiring to the future for inspiration
to guide his brush. It was in the life of St. Francis, ‘the
little Brother of Assisi’, that Giotto, the great forerunner of the
‘new’ art, found that sense of humanity idealized that spurred
him to break away from the old conventional Byzantine models,
stiff, decorative, and inhuman, in order to attempt the realization
of life as he saw it around him in the street and field.</p>

<p>Cimabue, a famous Florentine painter, had found Giotto as a
shepherd lad, cutting pictures of the sheep grouped round him
with a stone upon the rockside. He carried the boy away to be
his apprentice, but the pupil soon excelled the master and not
merely Florence but all Italy heard of his wondrous colours and
designs. ‘He took nature for his guide,’ says Leonardo
da Vinci; and many are the tales of this kindly peasant genius,
small and ugly in appearance but full of the joy and humour of
the world that he studied so shrewdly. The Angevin King
Robert of Naples once asked him to suggest a symbol of his own
turbulent Southern kingdom, whereupon the artist drew a
donkey saddled, sniffing at another saddle lying on the ground.
‘Such are your subjects,’ he remarked, ‘that every day would
seek a new master.’ No politician could have made a more
fitting summary of mediaeval Naples.</p>

<p>Giotto’s chief fame to-day lies in his frescoes of the life of St.
Francis on the walls of the double chapel at Assisi and in the
Franciscan Church of Santa Croce in Florence. Most of them,
damaged by the action of time and weather on the rough plaster,
have been repaired to their disadvantage, though a few remain
unharmed to show the painter’s clear, delicate colouring and
boldness of outline. To the average sightseer to-day they seem
perhaps just legendary pictures, more or less crude in design, but
when Giotto painted we must remember that the crowds who
watched his brush in breathless admiration read as they gazed
the story of the most human of saints&mdash;a man who had but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">358</a></span>
lately walked amongst the Umbrian hills, and whose words
and deeds were to them more vivid than many a living
utterance.</p>

<p>To understand what the genius of Giotto meant to his own day
we must consider the stiff unreality of former art, just as we
cannot realize the greatness of Columbus by thinking of a modern
voyage from the Continent to America, but only by recalling the
primitive navigation of his time. Giotto, like Columbus, had
many imitators and followers, some of them famous names, but the
pioneer work that he had done for art was commemorated at the
Renaissance when, by the orders of Lorenzo de Medici, a Latin
epitaph was placed on his tomb containing these words: ‘Lo!
I am he by whom dead Art was restored to life ... by whom Art
became one with Nature.’</p>

<p>It would be impossible to condense satisfactorily in a few short
paragraphs the triumphant history of Renaissance painting, the
rapid development of which Giotto and his ‘school’ had made
practicable, or even to give a slight sketch of the artists on whom
that history depends. Never before has so much genius been
crowded into so few years; but before we leave this pre-eminent
age in modern Art, there is one arresting figure who must
be described, a man who more than any other embodies the
spirit of the Renaissance at its best, Leonardo da Vinci, ‘foremost
amongst the supreme masters of the world’.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Leonardo da Vinci</div>

<p>Leonardo ‘the Florentine’, as he liked to call himself,
was born in the fortified village of Vinci midway between
Florence and Pisa. The illegitimate son of a notary, born as it
would seem to no great heritage, he was yet early distinguished
amongst his fellows.</p>

<p>‘The richest gifts of Heaven,’ says Vasari, ‘are sometimes
showered upon the same person, and beauty, grace, and genius,
are combined in so rare a manner in one man that, to whatever
he may apply himself, every action is so divine that all others are
left behind him.’ This reads like exaggeration until we turn to the
facts that are known about Da Vinci’s life, and find he is all indeed
Vasari described&mdash;a giant amongst his fellows in physique
and intellect, and still more in practical imagination. So strong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">359</a></span>
was he that with his fingers he could bend a horseshoe straight,
so full of potent charm for all things living that his presence in
a room would draw men and women out of sadness, while in the
streets the wildest horses would willingly yield to his taming
power. Of the cruelty that rests like a stain on the Middle Ages
there was in him no trace&mdash;rather that hot compassion for
suffering and weakness so often allied with strength. It is told
of him as of St. Francis that he would buy the singing-birds sold
in cages in the street that he might set them free.</p>

<p>His copy-books are full of the drawings of horses, and probably
his greatest work of art, judged by the opinion of his day and
the rough sketches still extant of his design, was the statue he
modelled for Ludovico ‘Il Moro’ of Francesco Sforza, the
famous <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">condottiere</i> poised on horseback. Unfortunately it
perished almost at once, hacked in pieces by the French soldiery
when they drove Ludovico from his capital some years later.</p>

<p>Leonardo has been called the ‘true founder of the Italian
School of oil-painting’. His most celebrated picture, ‘The
Last Supper’, painted in oils as an experiment, on the walls of
a convent near Milan, began to flake away, owing to the damp,
even before the artist’s death. It has been so constantly retouched
since, that very little, save the consummate art in the
arrangement of the figures, and the general dramatic simplicity
of the scene depicted, is left to show the master-hand. Even
this is enough to convey his genius. Amongst the most famous
of his works that still remain are his ‘Mona Lisa’, sometimes
called ‘La Gioconda’, the portrait of a Neapolitan lady, and the
‘Madonna of the Rocks’, both in the gallery of the Louvre.</p>

<p>Leonardo excelled his age in engineering, in his knowledge
of anatomy and physics, in his inventive genius that led him to
guess at the power of steam, and struggle over models of aeroplanes,
at which his generation laughed and shrugged their
shoulders. He himself took keen pleasure in such versatility,
but his art, that held other men spellbound with admiration,
would plunge him in depression. ‘When he sat down to paint
he seemed overcome with fear’, says one account of him, and
describes how he would alter and finally destroy, in despair of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">360</a></span>
attaining his ideal, canvases that those about him considered
already perfect. It is little wonder then that few finished works
came from the brush of this indefatigable worker; but his
influence on his age and after-centuries was none the less
prodigious.</p>

<p>Leonardo stands for all that was best in the Renaissance&mdash;its
zest for truth, its eager vitality and love of experiment, but
most of all for its sympathy. He is the embodiment of that
motto that seems more than any other to express the Renaissance
outlook: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Homo sum; humani nil a me alienum puto</i>&mdash;‘I
am a man, and nothing pertaining to mankind is foreign to
my nature.’</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Italy, we have seen, was pre-eminently the home of the Renaissance&mdash;the
teacher destined to give the world the ‘New Learning’
as she had preserved the old during the Dark Ages. In those
sunny days, when Lorenzo ‘the Wise’, as well as ‘the Magnificent’,
ruled in Florence, and by his statesmanship preserved
so neat a balance of politics that the peninsula, divided by five
ambitious Powers, yet remained at peace, a glorious future
seemed assured; but in 1492, the year that Columbus discovered
America, Lorenzo died. ‘The peace of Italy is dead also,’
exclaimed a statesman with prophetic insight, when he heard
the news: and indeed the stability and moderation that Lorenzo
and his house had symbolized was soon threatened.</p>

<p>In Florence, Wisdom was succeeded by Folly in the person
of Piero, Lorenzo’s son, an Orsini on his mother’s side, and an
inheritor to the full of the haughty, intractable temperament of
the Roman baronage. Playing his football in the streets amongst
the shopkeepers’ open booths, insolent to the merchants his
father had courted, reckless of advice, Piero was soon to learn
that a despotism, such as that of the Medici, founded not on
armies but on public goodwill, falls at the first adverse wind.
This wind, a whirlwind for Italy, blew from France; but it was
Ludovico ‘Il Moro’, not the young Medici, who actually sowed
the seed.</p>

<p>‘Nervous and cringing,’ as Philip de Commines had described<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">361</a></span>
him, Ludovico had found himself involved by his treatment of
his nephew in a fog of suspicions and fears. Left to himself,
uneducated and ailing in health, Gian Galeazzo Sforza would
never have dared to thwart his ambitious uncle; but he had
married a Neapolitan princess of stronger fibre, a granddaughter
of Ferrante I, and when she complained to her relations, and
they in turn remonstrated with ‘Il Moro’, trouble began.</p>

<p>It seemed to Ludovico, assailed by secret visions of Naples
allying herself with Milan’s most dreaded enemy Venice, or
even with Florence and Rome to secure revenge and his own
downfall, that he must hastily give up the idea that Lorenzo had
advocated of a balance of power within the peninsula itself,
and look instead beyond the mountains for help and support.
Mediaeval annals could give many instances of Popes and former
rulers of Milan who had taken this same unpatriotic step, while
a ready excuse could be found for invoking the aid of France,
on account of the French King’s descent from the Second House
of Anjou, that Alfonso V, Ferrante’s father, had driven from
Naples.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>Acting, then, from motives of personal ambition, not from any
wide conception of statecraft, Ludovico persuaded Charles VIII
of France, son of Louis XI, that honour and glory lay in his
renewal of the old Angevin claims to Naples, and in 1494, with
a great flourish of trumpets, the French expedition started
across the Alps. ‘I will assist in making you greater than
Charlemagne,’ Ludovico had boasted, when dangling his bait
before the young French King’s eyes; but the results of what
he had intended were so far beyond his real expectations as to
give him new cause for ‘cringing and fear’. ‘The French,’ said
Pope Alexander VI sarcastically, ‘needed only a child’s wooden
spurs and chalk to mark up their lodgings for the night.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">French Invasion of Italy</div>

<p>Almost without opposition, and where they encountered it
achieving easy victories, the French marched through Italy from
north to south, entering Florence, that had driven Piero and his
brothers into exile, compelling the hasty submission of Rome,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">362</a></span>
sweeping the Aragonese from Naples, whose fickle population
came out with cheers to greet their new conquerors.</p>

<p>Certainly the causes of this victory were not due to the young
conqueror himself, with his ungainly body and over-developed
head, with his swollen ambitions and feeble brain, with his pious
talk of a crusade against the East, and the idle debauch for
which he and his subjects earned unenviable notoriety. Commines,
a Frenchman with a shrewd idea of his master’s incompetence,
believed that God must have directed the conquering
armies, since the wisdom of man had nothing to say to it; but
Italian historians found the cause of their country’s humiliation
in her political and military decadence.</p>

<p>We have seen how ‘Companies’ of hired soldiers held Italy
in thrall during the fourteenth century; but with the passing of
years what was once a serious business had become a complicated
kind of chess with mercenary levies for pawns. Fifteenth-century
<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">condottieri</i> were as great believers in war as ever
Sir John Hawkwood; but, susceptible to the veneer of civilization
that glosses the Renaissance, they had lost the mediaeval taste
for bloodshed. What they retained was the desire to prolong
indeterminate campaigns in order to draw their pay, while
reducing the dangers and hardships involved to the least
adequate pretence of real warfare. Here is Machiavelli’s
sarcastic commentary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘They spared no effort,’ he says, ‘to relieve themselves and
their men from fatigue and danger, not killing one another in
battle but making prisoners ... they would attack no town by
night nor would those within make sorties against their besieging
foes. Their camps were without rampart or trench. They
fought no winter campaigns.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Before the national levies of France, rough campaigners with
no taste for military chess but only determined on as speedy a
victory as possible, the make-believe armies of Italy were mown
down like ninepins or ran away. Thus clashed two opposing
systems&mdash;one real, the other by this time almost wholly
artificial&mdash;and because of its noise and stir, 1494, the year of
Charles VIII’s invasion of Italy, is often taken as the boundary-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">363</a></span>line
between mediaeval and modern times, just as the year 476,
when Romulus Augustulus gave up his crown, is accepted as
the beginning of the Middle Ages. In both cases it is not the
events of the actual year that can be said to have created the
change. They are merely the culminating evidence of the end
of an old order of things and the beginning of a new.</p>

<div class="sidenote">End of the Middle Ages</div>

<p>By 1494 Constantinople was in the hands of the Turks:
Columbus had discovered America: John Gutenburg had
invented his printing-press: Vasco da Gama was meditating his
voyage to India. All these things were witness of ‘a new birth’,
the infancy of a modern world; but the year 1494 stands also as
evidence of the death of an old, the mediaeval.</p>

<p>Stung by the oppression and insolence of their conquerors,
Italian armies and intrigue were to drive the French in the
years to come temporarily out of Naples; but in spite of this
success the effect of Charles VIII’s military ‘walk-over’ was
never to be effaced. Italy, in Roman times the centre of
Europe from which all law and order had radiated, had clung to
a fiction of this power and glory through mediaeval days. Now
at last the sham was exposed, and before the forces of nationality
her boasted supremacy collapsed. The centre of political
gravity had changed, and with it the traditions and ideals for
which the supremacy of Italy had stood.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
